# Topicals TikTok Clipping Campaign - Recommendations Report

## Executive Summary
This report provides actionable recommendations to improve the Topicals TikTok slideshow clipping campaign. The existing brief has strong brand positioning and organized assets, but lacks key operational details that will impact clipper performance and campaign ROI.

---

## What's Working Well

- **Clear brand positioning** - Black-owned, melanin-rich skin focus is well-differentiated in the market
- **Strong proof points** - "#1 eye treatment at Sephora" provides compelling social proof
- **Organized assets** - 20 images mapped to specific angles shows excellent preparation
- **Smart language guardrails** - Avoiding "bleaching/whitening" terminology protects brand reputation and aligns with brand values
- **Defined target audience** - Clear demographic and geographic targeting (18-45, 80% female, coastal + key cities)

---

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. CPM Structure & Compensation Clarity

**Issue:** The brief doesn't specify payment terms, which creates friction with clippers and makes budgeting difficult.

**Missing Details:**
- CPM rate being offered to clippers
- View count thresholds for payment tiers
- Payment timeline (net 15? net 30?)
- Minimum performance requirements

**Recommendation:** Add a clear compensation table:

| View Threshold | Payout |
|----------------|--------|
| 100K - 499K | $50 |
| 500K - 999K | $150 |
| 1M+ | $300 |
| 5M+ | $500 + bonus negotiation |

**Payment Terms:** Net 15 from verified view count. Views verified 7 days post-publish to account for delayed viral performance.

---

### 2. Hook Framework for First Slides

**Issue:** Slideshow content lives or dies on the first slide. The 10 angles have concepts but lack specific first-slide hooks that stop the scroll.

**Recommendation:** Add 3 proven hook templates per angle. Examples:

**For "Lazy Girl Eye Mask Moment":**
- "POV: You finally found a dark spot treatment that actually works on melanin-rich skin"
- "The $24 product Sephora literally can't keep in stock"
- "Why didn't anyone tell me about this sooner?"

**For "Aesthetic Unboxing":**
- "The prettiest skincare unboxing you'll see today"
- "New skincare just dropped and I'm obsessed"
- "Adding to my shelfie immediately"

**For Faded product angles:**
- "3 weeks with this dark spot serum... here's what happened"
- "My esthetician asked what I've been using"
- "The before and after that made me a believer"

---

### 3. Audio Direction & Trending Sounds

**Issue:** Brief says "trending audio" but provides no specific guidance, leading to inconsistent content and potential brand mismatch.

**Missing Details:**
- Current trending sounds that fit the brand
- Audio mood guidance (chill, hype, ASMR, voiceover?)
- Whether clippers can use any sound or must choose from approved list

**Recommendation:** Provide 5-10 pre-approved trending sounds with direct links, updated weekly.

**Audio Mood Guidelines:**
- **Preferred:** Chill R&B, soft aesthetic sounds, satisfying ASMR, empowering female vocals
- **Avoid:** Aggressive/loud audio, controversial sounds, sounds with problematic origins

**Sound Update Cadence:** Campaign manager updates approved sound list every Monday via shared Google Sheet.

---

### 4. CTA Strategy & Attribution

**Issue:** No clear direction on calls-to-action or tracking, making ROI measurement impossible.

**Missing Details:**
- Discount codes for tracking attribution
- Specific CTA language guidance
- Whether clippers should drive to mytopicals.com, Sephora, or Amazon

**Recommendation:**

**Unique Tracking Codes:** Assign each clipper a unique code (e.g., CLIP001, CLIP002, or personalized like SKINBYJADE)
- 10% discount for customers
- Clipper earns additional $0.50 per code redemption
- Enables precise attribution tracking

**CTA Hierarchy:**
1. Primary: "Link in bio" driving to mytopicals.com (highest margin)
2. Secondary: "Available at Sephora" (social proof play)
3. Tertiary: Amazon (convenience play)

**CTA Language Examples:**
- "Link in my bio for 10% off"
- "Code [CLIPNAME] saves you 10%"
- "Comment FADED and I'll send you the link"

---

### 5. Performance Benchmarks & Success Metrics

**Issue:** No defined success metrics make it impossible to evaluate campaign performance or optimize.

**Recommendation:** Establish clear internal benchmarks:

| Metric | Target | Good | Excellent |
|--------|--------|------|-----------|
| Effective CPM | $5.00 | $3.50 | $2.00 |
| Engagement Rate | 3% | 5% | 8%+ |
| Click-Through Rate | 0.5% | 1% | 2%+ |
| Code Redemption Rate | 0.1% | 0.25% | 0.5%+ |
| Average Views/Post | 50K | 150K | 500K+ |

**Tracking Dashboard:** Create shared dashboard showing:
- Total views across all clipper content
- Total spend vs. revenue attributed
- Top performing clippers (for future partnerships)
- Top performing angles (for creative optimization)

---

### 6. Content Approval Process

**Issue:** No clarity on whether clippers need approval before posting, creating delays or brand risk.

**Recommendation:** Implement tiered approval system:

**No Approval Needed:**
- Posts using provided angles exactly as described
- Using pre-approved audio
- Following all language guidelines

**Approval Required (24hr turnaround):**
- Custom angles or significant creative deviation
- Voiceover scripts
- Any claims not in the brief

**Approval Contact:** helena@mytopicals.com
**Turnaround:** 24 hours for standard requests, 4 hours for time-sensitive trending moments

**Brand Safety Checklist (clipper self-review):**
- [ ] No "bleaching/whitening/lightening" language
- [ ] Black-owned status mentioned correctly
- [ ] Product claims match brief exactly
- [ ] Audio is brand-appropriate

---

### 7. Expanded Angle Library

**Issue:** 10 angles will get repetitive across multiple clippers, leading to content fatigue.

**Recommendation:** Add 5 additional angles:

**Duet/Stitch Bait:**
- Create a "controversial" opinion post to stitch: "Unpopular opinion: most dark spot treatments don't work on darker skin tones"
- Clippers stitch with product reveal

**Before/After Transformation:**
- Photo progression format (Week 1 → Week 4)
- "What 30 days of consistency looks like"

**"Things in my cart" / "Sephora Haul":**
- Blend Topicals into broader haul content
- More organic, less sponsored feel

**Storytime Hooks:**
- "The product that saved my skin before my wedding"
- "How I finally fixed my dark spots after trying everything"

**Routine Integration:**
- "My 5-minute morning routine"
- "Night routine for hyperpigmentation"

---

### 8. New Product Launch Amplification (Dark Spot Patches - 1/20)

**Issue:** The Faded Dark Spot Patches launching 1/20 is buried in the brief. This should be the campaign tentpole moment.

**Recommendation:** Create launch day surge strategy:

**Launch Day Bonus:**
"First 50 clippers to post about Dark Spot Patches on launch day (1/20) receive 2x standard payout"

**Embargo Strategy:**
- Send product to top 20 clippers 1 week early
- Embargo lifts 1/20 at 9am EST
- Coordinated posting creates trending moment

**Launch-Specific Hooks:**
- "The new Topicals drop just hit different"
- "Finally got my hands on the new patches everyone's talking about"
- "First impressions of the brand new Faded patches"

**Hashtag Coordination:**
- #TopicalsNewDrop
- #FadedPatches
- Primary campaign hashtag TBD
