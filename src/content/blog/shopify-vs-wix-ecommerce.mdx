  - question: "Is Shopify better than Wix for e-commerce?"
    answer: "For dedicated e-commerce businesses, Shopify is generally the better choice due to its extensive selling features, larger app ecosystem, better inventory management, and superior scalability. However, Wix can be ideal for small businesses or creators who want a website with light e-commerce functionality, as it offers easier design customization and lower starting costs."
  - question: "Can I migrate from Wix to Shopify?"
    answer: "Yes, you can migrate from Wix to Shopify. You'll need to export your products (as a CSV file), customer data, and content, then import them into Shopify. Several migration apps can help automate this process. Note that you'll need to rebuild your site design and may need to redirect URLs to maintain SEO value."
  - question: "Which platform has lower transaction fees, Shopify or Wix?"
    answer: "If you use Shopify Payments, Shopify charges 0% additional transaction fees (just payment processing). If you use third-party payment gateways, Shopify charges 0.5%-2% depending on your plan. Wix does not charge additional transaction fees on any e-commerce plan beyond standard payment processing fees, which typically range from 2.6% + $0.30 per transaction."
  - question: "Do I need coding skills to use Shopify or Wix?"
    answer: "Neither platform requires coding skills for basic store setup and management. Wix offers a more intuitive drag-and-drop interface that's beginner-friendly. Shopify has a slightly steeper learning curve but is still manageable for non-technical users. Both platforms allow custom code modifications for advanced users who want more control."
  - question: "Which platform is better for dropshipping, Shopify or Wix?"
    answer: "Shopify is significantly better for dropshipping due to its extensive integration with dropshipping apps like DSers, Spocket, and Printful. Shopify's app ecosystem includes hundreds of dropshipping solutions with features like automated order fulfillment, supplier management, and inventory syncing. Wix has limited dropshipping integrations in comparison."

## Platform Overview: Understanding the Core Differences

Before diving into specific features, it's important to understand what each platform was built for.

### Shopify: Built for Selling

Shopify was created in 2006 specifically for e-commerce. Every feature, tool, and integration is designed with online selling in mind. From inventory management to multi-channel selling, Shopify treats e-commerce as its primary mission.

The platform powers over 4 million stores worldwide, from small side hustles to enterprise brands like Gymshark, Allbirds, and Kylie Cosmetics. [Try Shopify free for 3 days](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624) to experience its e-commerce-first approach.

### Wix: Website Builder with E-commerce

Wix started as a general website builder in 2006, adding e-commerce features over time. While it now offers robust selling capabilities, e-commerce is one of many functions rather than its sole focus.

This origin shapes how each platform approaches online selling. Shopify assumes you're building a store; Wix assumes you might want a store as part of a larger website.

## E-commerce Features Comparison

**Winner: Tie** - Both deliver solid mobile experiences, though Shopify edges ahead for mobile conversion optimization.

## Pricing and Value

### Shopify Pricing (2026)

| Plan | Monthly Price | Transaction Fee | Features |
|------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Basic** | $39/month | 2.9% + $0.30 | Essential e-commerce features |
| **Shopify** | $105/month | 2.6% + $0.30 | Professional reports, more staff accounts |
| **Advanced** | $399/month | 2.4% + $0.30 | Advanced reporting, third-party calculated shipping |
| **Plus** | $2,300/month | Custom | Enterprise features, dedicated support |

### Wix Pricing (2026)

| Plan | Monthly Price | E-commerce Features |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Light** | $17/month | Basic website, no e-commerce |
| **Core** | $29/month | Limited e-commerce features |
| **Business** | $36/month | Full e-commerce, 100 products |
| **Business Elite** | $159/month | Unlimited products, priority support |

### Total Cost Analysis

The sticker price doesn't tell the whole story. Consider these additional costs:

**Shopify Additional Costs:**
- Theme: $0-$400 (one-time)
- Apps: $0-$200+/month (varies widely)
- Transaction fees: 0% with Shopify Payments
- Domain: $14/year (or use existing)

**Wix Additional Costs:**
- Template: $0 (all free)
- Apps: $0-$50+/month (generally cheaper)
- Transaction fees: 0% (payment processor only)
- Domain: $0 first year, $16+/year after

**Winner: Depends on scale** - Wix appears cheaper, but Shopify's lower transaction fees and better conversion tools often deliver better ROI at higher volumes. For small stores under $10K/month, Wix can be more economical. For stores exceeding that, Shopify typically wins on value.

## Scalability and Growth

### Shopify Scalability

Shopify handles massive scale gracefully:
- Flash sale and high-traffic management
- Global CDN infrastructure
- Shopify Plus for enterprise needs
- Unlimited bandwidth and traffic
- Multi-currency and multi-language
- International markets management
- Wholesale and B2B capabilities
- Advanced automation tools

**Enterprise clients like Gymshark and MVMT scaled from startup to $100M+ on Shopify without platform changes.**

### Wix Scalability

Wix supports growth to a point:
- Good for small to medium businesses
- Bandwidth limits on lower plans
- Less robust for very high traffic
- Limited B2B functionality
- Fewer enterprise features
- International selling supported
- Growth can require platform migration

**Winner: Shopify** - No contest. Shopify is built for scale, from first sale to enterprise. Wix works well for smaller operations but may require migration as you grow significantly.

## App Ecosystem and Integrations

### Shopify App Store

- 8,000+ apps available
- Apps for every conceivable function
- Robust review system
- Official partner apps (Meta, Google, etc.)

- Growing selection
- Fewer specialized e-commerce tools
- Limited third-party options
- Good for basic needs

**Winner: Shopify** - The app ecosystem isn't even close. Shopify's 8,000+ apps versus Wix's 500+ means more options, better specialization, and solutions for edge cases that Wix can't address.

## Who Should Choose Shopify?

[Shopify is the better choice](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624) if you:

- **Run a dedicated e-commerce business** - Selling is your primary focus
- **Plan to scale significantly** - You're building for growth
- **Need advanced inventory management** - Multiple locations, variants, or large catalogs
- **Sell on multiple channels** - Amazon, social media, marketplaces
- **Want dropshipping capabilities** - Extensive app ecosystem supports this
- **Need robust shipping tools** - Discounted rates and multi-location fulfillment
- **Require subscription commerce** - Apps like ReCharge integrate seamlessly
- **Have high transaction volume** - Lower fees save money at scale

## Who Should Choose Wix?

Wix is the better choice if you:

- **Need a website with some e-commerce** - Store is secondary to content
- **Prioritize design freedom** - Want pixel-perfect creative control
- **Have a small product catalog** - Under 100 products
- **Are on a tight budget** - Lower starting costs
- **Want simplicity over power** - Ease of use matters most
- **Don't need extensive integrations** - Basic functionality suffices
- **Are a service business with products** - Courses, bookings + merchandise

## The Verdict: Which Platform Wins?

**For serious e-commerce: Shopify wins decisively.**

If your primary goal is selling products online and growing a retail business, Shopify's purpose-built features, scalability, and ecosystem make it the superior choice. The investment pays off through better conversion tools, lower transaction costs at scale, and enterprise-ready infrastructure.

**For website-first businesses with light selling: Wix is a strong contender.**

If you're a creator, blogger, or service provider who wants to sell some products alongside your primary content or services, Wix's flexibility and lower costs make sense.

### The Numbers Support This

- Average Shopify store conversion rate: 1.4%
- Average Wix e-commerce conversion rate: 0.8-1.0%
- Shop Pay checkout conversion: 50% higher than standard
- Shopify stores processing $1M+: Hundreds of thousands
- Enterprise brands built on Wix: Relatively few

### Our Recommendation

For most readers evaluating e-commerce platforms, we recommend starting with Shopify. The platform's e-commerce DNA means you're building on infrastructure designed for selling, not retrofitted for it.

Yes, the monthly cost is higher than Wix's entry plans. But the revenue uplift from better checkout conversion, multi-channel selling, and shipping discounts typically outweighs the price difference within months.

## Making Your Final Decision

Consider these questions:

1. **What's your primary goal?** (Selling products vs. building a website)
2. **How many products will you sell?** (Dozens vs. hundreds/thousands)
3. **Where will you sell?** (Website only vs. multi-channel)
4. **What's your growth trajectory?** (Side hustle vs. full-time business)
5. **What's your technical comfort?** (Need simplicity vs. can learn)

If you answered "selling products," "hundreds+," "multi-channel," "full-time business," and "can learn" - Shopify is your platform.

If you answered "building a website," "dozens," "website only," "side project," and "need simplicity" - Wix deserves consideration.
