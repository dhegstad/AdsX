  - question: "How do AI assistants handle allergen information when recommending food products?"
    answer: "AI assistants parse allergen information from product data, structured markup, and content across retail platforms and brand websites. When users specify allergen restrictions (like 'peanut-free snacks'), AI filters recommendations to only include products with clearly documented allergen-free status. Products with incomplete or ambiguous allergen data are typically excluded from safety-critical recommendations."
  - question: "What are the FDA's Big 9 allergens that CPG brands must communicate for AI visibility?"
    answer: "The FDA's Big 9 major food allergens are: milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soybeans, and sesame. AI systems specifically look for clear declarations of these allergens in product data. Brands should explicitly state which allergens are present, absent, or pose cross-contamination risks for each product."
  - question: "How should brands communicate cross-contamination risks for AI recommendations?"
    answer: "Brands should use clear, standardized language like 'Made in a facility that also processes peanuts' or 'May contain traces of tree nuts.' This information should appear in product descriptions, structured data, and FAQ sections. AI assistants use this data to make appropriate recommendations, often excluding products with cross-contamination warnings for users with severe allergies."
  - question: "What structured data markup should CPG brands use for allergen information?"
    answer: "CPG brands should implement schema.org Product markup with detailed nutrition and allergen properties. Include suitableForDiet for dietary restrictions, use the RestrictedDiet vocabulary, and add custom properties for allergen-free certifications. This structured data helps AI systems accurately parse and recommend products for specific dietary needs."
  - question: "How do dietary restriction labels like gluten-free and vegan affect AI product recommendations?"
    answer: "Dietary restriction labels are high-priority ranking factors for AI recommendations. When users ask for 'gluten-free breakfast options' or 'vegan protein bars,' AI systems specifically match products with verified dietary labels. Products with third-party certifications (Certified Gluten-Free, Vegan Action certified) receive higher confidence scores in AI recommendations than self-declared claims."

Allergen information has always been critical for consumer safety. In the age of AI-powered product discovery, it's now equally critical for product visibility. When consumers ask AI assistants for "nut-free snacks for my child" or "gluten-free pasta that tastes good," the quality and clarity of your allergen information determines whether your products get recommended or remain invisible.

For CPG brands, the stakes are significant. Poor allergen data doesn't just mean missed sales—it means being excluded from safety-critical recommendations entirely. AI systems are designed to err on the side of caution, which means ambiguous or incomplete allergen information results in your products being filtered out of recommendations for allergy-conscious consumers.

This guide covers how CPG brands should present allergen information for maximum AI visibility while maintaining the safety standards that protect consumers.

## Why Allergen Information Matters More Than Ever for AI

The way consumers find products for dietary restrictions is fundamentally changing. Traditional shopping required reading labels in store aisles or searching retailer websites with basic filters. AI shopping assistants are transforming this into a conversational experience where consumers describe their needs and receive personalized recommendations.

### How Consumers Use AI for Allergen-Safe Shopping

Consider these real-world AI queries:

- "What are some good lunch snacks for a kid with a peanut allergy?"
- "Best bread brands that are actually gluten-free and taste good"
- "Protein bars safe for someone with a soy allergy"
- "Dairy-free ice cream that doesn't have coconut"
- "Crackers my whole family can eat—we have nut and sesame allergies"

Each of these queries requires AI to understand complex allergen information, cross-reference it with product data, and make recommendations that are both relevant and safe.

### The AI Safety Filter Effect

AI assistants prioritize user safety when making recommendations. This creates a filtering effect:

| Allergen Information Quality | AI Recommendation Behavior |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Complete, structured, verified | Confidently recommended for matching queries |
| Present but unstructured | May be recommended with caveats |
| Incomplete or ambiguous | Excluded from allergen-specific queries |
| Contradictory across platforms | Excluded entirely for safety |

The bottom line: if your allergen information isn't clear, complete, and consistent, AI will recommend your competitors instead.

## The Big 9: Major Allergens Every CPG Brand Must Address

The FDA recognizes nine major food allergens that account for the vast majority of severe allergic reactions. For AI visibility, explicit communication about each of these allergens is essential.

### The FDA's Big 9 Allergens

1. **Milk** — Includes all dairy derivatives (casein, whey, lactose)
2. **Eggs** — Includes albumin and other egg-derived ingredients
3. **Fish** — Specific species should be identified (salmon, tuna, cod)
4. **Shellfish** — Crustaceans (shrimp, crab, lobster) and mollusks
5. **Tree Nuts** — Almonds, walnuts, cashews, pistachios, and others
6. **Peanuts** — Legume-based, separate from tree nuts
7. **Wheat** — Includes spelt, kamut, and other wheat varieties
8. **Soybeans** — Includes soy lecithin and soy derivatives
9. **Sesame** — Added to the list in 2023, now mandatory

### How to Communicate Each Allergen for AI Visibility

For each product, your data should explicitly address three categories:

**Contains:** Which major allergens are ingredients
```
Contains: Milk, Eggs, Wheat
```

**Free From:** Which major allergens are verifiably absent
```
Free From: Peanuts, Tree Nuts, Soy, Sesame, Fish, Shellfish
```

**May Contain (Cross-Contamination):** Potential trace exposure
```
May Contain: Tree Nuts (processed in shared facility)
```

This explicit structure enables AI to parse your allergen status accurately and make appropriate recommendations.

## Cross-Contamination Warnings: The Critical Safety Layer

Cross-contamination information is where many CPG brands fall short in AI visibility. For consumers with severe allergies, trace exposure can be life-threatening—and AI systems recognize this.

### Why Cross-Contamination Data Matters for AI

When a user asks for "peanut-free snacks," AI must determine:
- Products that don't contain peanuts as an ingredient
- Products manufactured without peanut cross-contamination risk
- Products with acceptable cross-contamination protocols

If your product is peanut-free but manufactured in a facility that processes peanuts, AI may still recommend it—but only if this information is clearly communicated so users can make informed decisions.

### Standard Cross-Contamination Language

Use consistent, standardized phrasing that AI can reliably parse:

**Facility-Level Risk:**
- "Manufactured in a facility that also processes [allergen]"
- "Made on shared equipment with [allergen]"
- "Produced in a facility that handles [allergen]"

**No Cross-Contamination Risk:**
- "Produced in a dedicated [allergen]-free facility"
- "Manufactured in a facility that does not process [allergen]"
- "Made on dedicated equipment with no [allergen] exposure"

**Third-Party Verified:**
- "Certified [allergen]-free by [certification body]"
- "Verified [allergen]-free through third-party testing"
- "Meets [organization] standards for [allergen]-free production"

### Communicating Multiple Cross-Contamination Risks

For products with multiple potential allergen exposures, structure the information clearly:

```
Allergen Information:
- Contains: Wheat, Soy
- Free From: Peanuts, Eggs, Fish, Shellfish, Sesame
- May Contain Traces: Tree Nuts, Milk (shared facility)
- Produced: On dedicated gluten-containing line
- Facility Status: Peanut-free facility since 2019
```

This comprehensive format gives AI everything it needs to make accurate recommendations.

## Dietary Restrictions Beyond Allergens

Allergens are just one dimension of dietary restrictions. AI visibility requires clear communication across the full spectrum of dietary needs.

### Gluten-Free

The gluten-free market continues to expand, serving both celiac disease patients and those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity.

**Key considerations for AI visibility:**

- Distinguish between "gluten-free" (meets FDA <20 ppm standard) and "wheat-free"
- Certifications (GFCO, Celiac Support Association) carry more weight than self-declarations
- Specify if naturally gluten-free or formulated to be gluten-free
- Address oat cross-contamination specifically (oats are naturally gluten-free but often contaminated)

**Optimal format:**
```
Gluten-Free: Yes
Certification: Certified Gluten-Free (GFCO, <10ppm)
Wheat Status: Wheat-free formulation
Oat Information: Uses purity protocol oats tested for gluten
```

### Vegan and Plant-Based

The plant-based market requires precise communication about animal-derived ingredients.

**AI-relevant vegan/plant-based information:**

- Vegan (no animal products or by-products)
- Vegetarian (may include dairy, eggs, honey)
- Plant-based (primarily plant ingredients, may contain small amounts of animal products)
- Animal-derived ingredients to specify: gelatin, carmine, L-cysteine, vitamin D3, omega-3 source

**Certifications that improve AI recommendation confidence:**
- Vegan Action (Certified Vegan logo)
- BeVeg Certified
- The Vegan Society Trademark
- Plant Based Foods Association member

### Kosher and Halal

Religious dietary requirements require specific certifications and clear communication:

**Kosher considerations:**
- Kosher certification body (OU, OK, Kof-K, Star-K)
- Kosher-Parve (no meat or dairy)
- Kosher-Dairy or Kosher-Meat designation
- Passover suitability

**Halal considerations:**
- Halal certification body
- Alcohol-free verification
- Animal product sourcing (if applicable)

### Keto, Paleo, and Whole30

Diet-specific programs have precise requirements that AI uses for matching:

**Keto:**
- Net carbs per serving (total carbs minus fiber and sugar alcohols)
- Sugar content
- Protein-to-fat ratio

**Paleo:**
- Grain-free status
- Legume-free status
- Dairy-free status
- Refined sugar-free

**Whole30:**
- Official Whole30 Approved status
- Compliance with all program requirements
- No added sugars (including honey, maple syrup)

## Structured Data for Allergen Information

Structured data markup is how you communicate allergen information directly to AI systems in a machine-readable format.

### Schema.org Product Markup for Allergens

Implement comprehensive schema markup on your product pages:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "Organic Almond Butter",
  "brand": {
    "@type": "Brand",
    "name": "NutGood Foods"
  },
  "description": "Creamy organic almond butter made with single-ingredient roasted almonds",
  "category": "Nut Butters",
  "nutrition": {
    "@type": "NutritionInformation",
    "servingSize": "2 tbsp (32g)",
    "calories": "190 calories",
    "fatContent": "17g",
    "proteinContent": "7g",
    "carbohydrateContent": "6g"
  },
  "suitableForDiet": [
    "https://schema.org/GlutenFreeDiet",
    "https://schema.org/VeganDiet",
    "https://schema.org/LowCarbohydrateDiet"
  ],
  "additionalProperty": [
    {
      "@type": "PropertyValue",
      "name": "Contains Allergens",
      "value": "Tree Nuts (Almonds)"
    },
    {
      "@type": "PropertyValue",
      "name": "Free From",
      "value": "Peanuts, Wheat, Soy, Dairy, Eggs, Fish, Shellfish, Sesame"
    },
    {
      "@type": "PropertyValue",
      "name": "Facility Information",
      "value": "Produced in a dedicated tree nut facility. Peanut-free."
    },
    {
      "@type": "PropertyValue",
      "name": "Certifications",
      "value": "USDA Organic, Non-GMO Project Verified, Certified Gluten-Free"
    }
  ]
}
</script>
```

### Using RestrictedDiet Vocabulary

Schema.org provides specific diet types you should leverage:

- `DiabeticDiet` — Suitable for diabetic dietary needs
- `GlutenFreeDiet` — Contains no gluten
- `HalalDiet` — Prepared according to Halal standards
- `HinduDiet` — Suitable for Hindu dietary practices
- `KosherDiet` — Prepared according to Kosher standards
- `LowCalorieDiet` — Low in calories
- `LowFatDiet` — Low in fat
- `LowLactoseDiet` — Low in lactose
- `LowSaltDiet` — Low in sodium
- `VeganDiet` — Contains no animal products
- `VegetarianDiet` — Contains no meat

Include all applicable diet types in your structured data to maximize AI matching.

## Retailer Platform Optimization

Your allergen information must be complete and consistent across every retail platform.

### Amazon Product Data

Amazon's attribute system includes specific allergen fields:

**Required allergen attributes:**
- Allergen Information (contains)
- Dietary preferences (certifications)
- Specialty (gluten-free, organic, etc.)
- Diet type

**Q&A optimization for allergens:**
Build out comprehensive Q&A sections addressing common allergen questions:
- "Is this safe for someone with a peanut allergy?"
- "Is this made in a facility with tree nuts?"
- "Is the gluten-free certification verified by third party?"
- "What's the cross-contamination protocol?"

### Instacart and Grocery Platforms

Grocery delivery platforms are implementing increasingly sophisticated allergen filtering:

- Complete all allergen tags in retailer portals
- Verify accuracy of auto-populated allergen data
- Request corrections for any inaccurate allergen flags
- Ensure consistency with your packaging claims

### DTC Website Requirements

Your direct-to-consumer website needs:

- Dedicated allergen information section per product
- Sortable/filterable product catalog by allergen status
- FAQ page addressing common allergen questions
- Schema markup on all product pages
- Consistent information matching retail platform data

## Building Trust Signals for Allergen-Related Queries

AI systems weight trust signals heavily when making allergen-related recommendations.

### Third-Party Certifications That Matter

| Certification | What It Verifies | AI Weight |
|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| GFCO Certified Gluten-Free | <10ppm gluten | High |
| Celiac Support Association | <5ppm gluten | Very High |
| Vegan Action Certified | No animal products | High |
| OU Kosher | Kosher compliance | High |
| FARE (Food Allergy Research) | Allergy-aware practices | Very High |
| SQF Certified | Food safety standards | Medium-High |
| Non-GMO Project | No GMO ingredients | Medium |

### Review Content and Allergen Trust

Reviews that mention allergen safety are powerful trust signals:

- "My daughter has a severe peanut allergy and we've trusted this brand for 3 years"
- "Finally a gluten-free product that doesn't cause any reaction"
- "As a celiac, I've tested this with zero issues"

Encourage customers with dietary restrictions to mention their experience with allergen safety in reviews.

### Transparency and Communication

Brands that proactively communicate about allergens build trust:

- Publish allergen and manufacturing protocols
- Share facility certifications and audit results
- Respond to allergen questions within 24 hours
- Update product information immediately when formulations change

## Common Allergen Communication Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Inconsistent Information Across Platforms

**Problem:** Amazon says "may contain peanuts" while your website says "peanut-free facility."

**Impact:** AI excludes your product from peanut-free queries due to conflicting data.

**Fix:** Maintain a single source of truth. Audit all platforms quarterly.

### Mistake 2: Missing Cross-Contamination Data

**Problem:** Product is allergen-free but manufactured in a shared facility—this information is missing.

**Impact:** AI cannot assess true safety, may exclude from recommendations to be cautious.

**Fix:** Always include facility and equipment sharing information.

### Mistake 3: Generic "May Contain" Warnings

**Problem:** Using overly broad warnings like "May contain one or more tree nuts" without specificity.

**Impact:** AI cannot match to specific allergen queries (e.g., "almond-free but other tree nuts okay").

**Fix:** Be specific about which allergens pose cross-contamination risks.

### Mistake 4: Outdated Certification Information

**Problem:** Listing certifications that have lapsed or changed status.

**Impact:** AI may recommend based on invalid certifications, causing trust issues.

**Fix:** Review and update certification status annually.

### Mistake 5: No Structured Data Implementation

**Problem:** Allergen information only in product images or PDFs, not in parseable text or markup.

**Impact:** AI cannot read or interpret your allergen data.

**Fix:** Implement schema markup and include allergen information in text content.

## Measuring AI Visibility for Allergen Queries

### Test Queries to Monitor

Regularly test AI assistants with allergen-specific queries:

- "[Allergen]-free [product category]"
- "Safe [product type] for [allergen] allergy"
- "Best [dietary restriction] [product category]"
- "[Your brand] allergen information"
- "[Your brand] safe for [specific allergy]"

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Action if Below Target |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| Mention rate for allergen queries | >30% in category | Improve allergen data completeness |
| Accuracy of allergen mentions | 100% | Correct any inaccurate AI information |
| Position in recommendations | Top 3 | Enhance trust signals and reviews |
| Cross-contamination accuracy | 100% | Update facility information |
