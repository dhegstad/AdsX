  - question: "What is the difference between a pre-order and a backorder?"
    answer: "A pre-order is a deliberate sales strategy where customers purchase a product before it's manufactured or in stock, typically with clear expected delivery dates. A backorder occurs when a customer tries to buy a product that's temporarily out of stock and is added to a queue for the next inventory arrival. Pre-orders are proactive and announced in advance; backorders are reactive and often unexpected by customers. Shopify pre-order apps let you control the pre-order experience and messaging, while backorders happen automatically when inventory runs out."
  - question: "Can I use pre-orders without a Shopify app?"
    answer: "Technically yes, but it's challenging. You could manually track pre-orders using a separate form or CSV, but this creates operational friction and error risk. Shopify pre-order apps automate inventory management, payment processing, customer communication, and fulfillment tracking. They prevent overselling, sync with your Shopify inventory, and send automated reminders—tasks that would require hours of manual work otherwise. For any serious pre-order strategy, an app is essential."
  - question: "Should I collect full payment upfront for pre-orders?"
    answer: "It depends on your product category and customer expectations. High-ticket items (furniture, electronics) often use two-stage payment: deposit at pre-order, final payment before shipment. Low-cost products typically collect full payment immediately to reduce churn risk. Some brands use payment plans or allow customers to choose. The key is transparency—clearly state your payment terms before checkout. Apps like Preorder Manager and Presales let you customize payment collection to match your business model."
  - question: "What's the ideal pre-order timeline for product launches?"
    answer: "The best pre-order window depends on product type and manufacturing time. For physical products, aim for 4-12 weeks: enough time to gauge demand and manufacture, not so long that customers lose interest or cancel. Limited editions often use 2-4 weeks to create urgency. Digital products can pre-order 1-2 weeks before launch. Communicate the timeline clearly and set expectations from day one. Use apps that send automated countdown reminders and fulfillment updates to keep customers engaged throughout the pre-order period."
  - question: "How do I manage customer expectations during the pre-order period?"
    answer: "Clear communication is critical. In your product listing, state the expected ship date, payment terms, and cancellation policy explicitly. Send automated emails at key milestones: order confirmation, production start, production complete, shipment notification. Include tracking information and realistic delivery windows. Shopify pre-order apps handle much of this automation, but you should also monitor support tickets and proactively address delays. Set a policy for handling delays (refunds, discounts, or ship-date extensions) and communicate it upfront to prevent disputes."

Pre-orders are one of the most powerful yet underutilized strategies in e-commerce. They let you sell products before they exist, validate demand before manufacturing, reduce inventory risk, and generate cash flow months ahead of physical delivery. For Shopify merchants, pre-orders unlock new business models: limited editions that build scarcity, product launches that generate buzz, and supplier coordination that matches inventory to actual demand rather than guesswork.

But running pre-orders at scale requires automation. Without the right tools, pre-orders become a operational nightmare: tracking partial payments, managing inventory conflicts, sending manual email updates, handling cancellations, and coordinating fulfillment across systems.

This guide breaks down the best Shopify pre-order apps, shows you how to choose between them based on your business model, and walks through best practices for managing customer expectations, collecting payments, and executing flawless product launches.

If you're new to [Shopify](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624), the platform natively supports basic inventory management, but pre-orders require third-party apps to handle the unique workflows we'll explore here.

## Why Pre-Orders Matter for Shopify Stores

Pre-orders solve three fundamental e-commerce problems:

**1. Cash Flow Acceleration**
Pre-order payments arrive immediately, sometimes months before you manufacture or receive goods. A store pre-selling $50,000 in inventory two months before manufacturing has immediate working capital to pay suppliers, fund production, or invest in marketing.

**2. Demand Validation**
Before committing to large manufacturing runs, pre-orders show exactly how many units you'll actually sell. A limited edition shoe that pre-orders 500 units tells you to manufacture 500, not 2,000 (inventory risk) or 100 (lost sales).

**3. Viral Launch Potential**
Products that pre-order create urgency and scarcity. "Only 300 units. Pre-order closes in 48 hours" generates conversions far better than "This product is in stock." Pre-orders are inherently scarce and exclusive, even if you manufacture unlimited quantities after launch.

The challenge: [Shopify](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624)'s native inventory system isn't built for pre-orders. You need tools that prevent overselling, track pre-order vs. in-stock products differently, and automate customer communication across the entire pre-order lifecycle.

## The 5 Best Shopify Pre-Order Apps

### 1. **Preorder Manager**

**Best for:** Advanced payment options and multi-stage pre-orders

**How it works:**
Preorder Manager lets you set a "pre-order start date," "estimated delivery date," and optional "automatic release date" when products convert to normal in-stock status.

---

### 2. **Presales by Switchify**

**Best for:** Simple, lightweight pre-order management and quick setup

**How it works:**
Presales is built for merchants who want pre-orders without complexity. Add a "pre-order" tag to products, set the expected delivery date, and Presales automatically swaps the "Add to Cart" button to "Pre-Order." Payment is collected immediately, and customers receive order confirmation and shipping updates.

**Key features:**

- Lightweight UI—doesn't clutter your store
- Excellent customer support
- Affordable for small-to-medium stores

**Cons:**
- Full payment collection only (no deposit options)
- Limited customization of email templates
- Fewer analytics compared to Preorder Manager

**Best for:** Merchants running occasional pre-orders, new product launches, or stores that want simplicity over advanced features.

---

### 3. **Pre-order Manager by Hextom**

**Best for:** High-volume pre-orders with advanced inventory tracking

**How it works:**
Hextom's Pre-order Manager is designed for scale. It handles unlimited pre-orders, syncs inventory across multiple sales channels, reserves inventory specifically for pre-order customers, and automates fulfillment notifications.

- Very flexible payment options

**Cons:**
- Higher tier pricing for busy stores

**Best for:** Multi-channel sellers, stores with monthly pre-order volumes over 100 units, or merchants selling on Amazon and Shopify simultaneously.

---

### 4. **Backorder Master**

**Best for:** Hybrid pre-order + backorder management

**How it works:**
Backorder Master bridges the gap between planned pre-orders (products you intentionally sell before launch) and reactive backorders (products that sell out unexpectedly). You can toggle any product between pre-order and backorder mode, set estimated delivery dates, and manage customer queues.

**Key features:**
- Pre-order and backorder toggle for any product
- Queue management for fairness (FIFO—first in, first out)

**Pricing:** Free for basic backorders, $24.99/month for pre-order + payment flexibility features

**Pros:**
- Covers both pre-orders and reactive backorders in one app
- Customer self-service portal reduces support tickets
- Payment plan options for expensive items
- Printful integration for print-on-demand and dropship businesses

**Cons:**
- Less focused than single-purpose pre-order apps
- Customization options are more limited for pre-order page design
- Best for businesses that expect reactive backorders, not just planned pre-orders

**Best for:** Stores that want flexibility between pre-orders and backorders, print-on-demand businesses, or merchants needing customer self-service for order modifications.

---

### 5. **Rush: Pre-order & Pre-launch**

**Best for:** Consumer brand launches and viral pre-order campaigns

**How it works:**
Rush is designed specifically for product launches. It creates dedicated pre-order landing pages, tracks viral metrics (shares, referrals, social mentions), integrates with email marketing platforms, and coordinates the pre-order-to-launch transition.

**Key features:**

- Referral tracking (invite friends, unlock discounts)
- Social sharing incentives (share on Twitter/Instagram for bonus entries)
- Email integration with Klaviyo, Drip, and Mailchimp
- Launch countdown with real-time unit tracker
- Post-launch fulfillment coordination

**Pricing:** $49–199/month depending on traffic and pre-order volume

**Pros:**
- Best pre-order UX for building hype and virality
- Referral mechanics drive viral growth
- Integration with best-in-class email platforms
- Excellent for consumer brands and D2C launches

**Cons:**
- Highest price point of the five apps

## Pre-Order vs. Backorder: Key Differences

Before implementing any pre-order app, you need to set up a [Shopify store](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624) with a solid foundation—proper inventory setup, clean product data, and basic analytics. Pre-order apps layer on top of this foundation, so make sure your core store is optimized first.



Understanding the distinction between pre-orders and backorders is essential for choosing the right app and setting customer expectations.

| Aspect | Pre-Order | Backorder |
|---|---|---|
| **Timing** | Announced and intentional, well before product availability | Reactive, happens when product sells out unexpectedly |
| **Customer Expectation** | Customer knows upfront it's pre-order; expects future delivery | Customer believes product is in stock; discovers it's not in checkout |
| **Marketing** | Intentional scarcity and exclusivity; generates hype | Unplanned; can feel like a negative experience |
| **Refund Risk** | Lower (customer opted in knowing the timeline) | Higher (customer expected immediate delivery) |
| **Production Impact** | Validate demand before manufacturing; optimize production run | Reactive inventory ordering; risk of under/over-ordering |
| **App Best Practice** | Preorder Manager, Presales, or Rush | Backorder Master, Hextom's app |

**Example:**
A fashion brand launching a limited-edition sneaker uses a pre-order: "This sneaker releases February 24. Pre-order now and we'll ship March 15." Customers know what they're getting and when. This is intentional scarcity.

The same brand sells out of a regular in-stock sneaker within 2 hours. Customers who missed the buy window see a "Backorder" option. They can order, but should know it will arrive in 2-3 weeks—this is a backorder.

Pre-orders are strategy. Backorders are damage control. Both need the right tools.

## Payment Collection Strategies for Pre-Orders

How you collect payment during the pre-order period dramatically affects customer satisfaction, refund rates, and cash flow. Here are the proven strategies:

### **1. Full Payment Upfront**

Collect 100% of the order value immediately at pre-order.

**Pros:**
- Maximum cash flow; you have customer money before manufacturing
- Simplest operationally; no payment coordination later
- Filters for serious buyers; reduces cancellation rates (sunk cost effect)

**Cons:**
- Higher refund requests if customers change minds during pre-order period
- Perceived as risky by customers (trusting you not to go bankrupt)
- Friction for high-ticket items ($500+)

**Best for:** Low-to-mid-price products ($15–150), products with strong brand loyalty, or short pre-order windows (2–4 weeks).

---

### **2. Deposit + Final Payment**

Collect a deposit (typically 25–50%) at pre-order, final payment before shipment.

**Pros:**
- Lower initial friction; customers feel less financial risk
- Deposit is non-refundable or partially refundable, discouraging flaky orders
- Final payment timing matches reality (you've completed production, confirmed delivery)
- Industry standard for high-ticket items (furniture, custom products, electronics)

**Cons:**
- Operational complexity; tracking two-stage payments
- Second payment failure rate is real (customer declines, bounced card, etc.)
- Requires strong communication to prevent surprises

**Best for:** Products over $200, long pre-order windows (8+ weeks), luxury or custom goods, or items with genuine production risk.

---

### **3. Payment Plan**

Spread the cost across 2–4 payments over the pre-order period.

**Pros:**
- Lowest friction for expensive purchases ($500+)
- Improves conversion on high-ticket items
- Appeals to price-conscious buyers

**Cons:**
- Higher operational overhead; multiple payment processing events
- Increased non-completion rate (customers miss final payments)
- Requires trust-building and communication
- Needs integration with payment plan processors like Affirm, Klarna, or PayPal Credit

**Best for:** High-ticket items ($300+), consumer electronics, furniture, or stores targeting price-sensitive segments.

---

### **4. Flexible: Customer Choice**

Offer multiple payment options at checkout and let customers decide.

**Pros:**
- Maximum flexibility; appeals to different customer segments
- Shows customer-first approach
- Can increase overall conversion

**Cons:**
- Operational complexity across multiple payment types
- Harder to forecast cash flow
- Requires clear communication at checkout

**Best for:** Premium brands, stores with diverse price points, or merchants wanting to maximize conversion across customer segments.

---

**Best Practice:** Whatever payment strategy you choose, state it clearly and unmistakably before checkout. A customer surprised by a deposit on "Full Payment" plans is a refund waiting to happen. Use your pre-order app's email automation to confirm the payment plan, and send a reminder email 7 days before the final payment is due.

---

## Managing Customer Expectations: The Critical Pre-Order Challenge

The #1 cause of pre-order dissatisfaction isn't delays—it's surprise. Customers who expected delivery by March 15 but find out in April that shipment is delayed become angry. Customers who knew from day one there might be delays, and who receive proactive updates monthly, stay patient.

### **Expectations to Set Upfront**

In your pre-order product page, include:

1. **Exact expected delivery date or window**
   - "Expected to ship: March 15, 2026"
   - Or: "Expected to ship: March 15–April 15, 2026" (for products with uncertainty)

2. **Clear cancellation policy**
   - "Cancellations accepted through [date]. After that, cancellation fees apply."
   - Or: "Full refund if you cancel before February 28. After that, deposit is non-refundable."

3. **Payment terms**
   - State deposit amount and due date for final payment
   - Clarify non-refundable vs. refundable components

4. **What could cause delays**
   - Be honest: manufacturing complications, shipping delays, supplier issues
   - Setting low expectations and exceeding them is better than the reverse

5. **How you'll communicate**
   - Promise specific email updates (e.g., "You'll get updates every Friday")
   - Be specific: "Production starts Feb 24 / Inventory ships to us by March 10 / You'll receive tracking by March 15"

### **Communication Timeline**

Automate these emails using your pre-order app or email marketing platform:

| Timing | Message |
|--------|---------|
| **Order confirmation (+0 min)** | Thank you for your pre-order. Expected ship date: [date]. Here's what happens next. |
| **Production start (+2 weeks)** | Great news! We've started manufacturing your [product]. On track for [ship date]. |
| **Inventory received (+4 weeks)** | Even better! Your products have arrived at our warehouse. Quality-checked and ready to pack. |
| **Shipping notification (+5 weeks)** | Your [product] is on the way! Tracking number: [link]. Estimated delivery: [date]. |
| **Post-delivery (+6 weeks)** | Your order has arrived. Please let us know if you have any issues. How are you loving it? |
| **If delayed (+6 weeks)** | We hit an unexpected [manufacturing/shipping] delay. New ship date is [new date]. Here's what happened and why. [Offer: discount/free shipping on next order.] |

The key: Never let customers discover a delay by checking their email without a warning. Proactive communication—even if it's bad news—preserves trust.

## Product Launch Pre-Orders: Best Practices

Launching a new product with a pre-order is fundamentally different from selling in-stock inventory. Here's the playbook:

### **4–6 Weeks Before Launch: Announcement & Hype**

- Create teaser content (social, email, landing pages)
- Build anticipation with behind-the-scenes content
- Announce pre-order open date and expected delivery date
- Set up email list for launch notification
- If using Rush or a custom landing page, drive traffic 2 weeks before pre-order opens

### **2 Weeks Before Pre-Order Opens: Pre-Launch Campaign**

- Announce pre-order opening date exactly
- Offer launch week incentive (free shipping, 15% off, exclusive gift)
- Send email to waitlist with launch time (e.g., "Pre-orders open Tuesday 10am PT")
- Coordinate with influencers/partners for launch day coverage

### **Launch Day: Go Live**

- Pre-order goes live on announced date/time
- Send email to full list linking to pre-order page
- Monitor server load (high-traffic pre-order launches can cause slowdowns)
- Track early conversions and adjust marketing in real-time (increase ad spend if converting well)

### **Week 1–2: Momentum Phase**

- Continue paid advertising to pre-order page (high ROAS immediately post-launch)
- Nurture email sequence: "Here's what customers love about [product]," "Only 200 units remaining," social proof
- Weekly communication on fulfillment progress (if you have anything to share)

### **Week 3–6: Conversion & Fulfillment**

- Shift from launch hype to ongoing conversion
- Continue social proof (customer testimonials, unboxing videos)
- Update on manufacturing progress monthly or more frequently if meaningful
- Prepare fulfillment logistics (coordinate with warehouse, shipping, suppliers)

### **Pre-Delivery Hype: Week 7–8**

- "Your product is shipping next week" email (huge open rates)
- Unboxing guide or quick-start tutorials (set expectations for when they receive it)
- "Here's what's in the box" sneak peek

### **Delivery Week: Final Mile**

- Shipping notification email with tracking
- Day-of-delivery SMS or notification (if you have that capability)
- Welcome email with next steps, warranty info, community links

### **Week 1 Post-Delivery: Engagement**

- Follow-up: "How do you love [product]?"
- Collect user-generated content (ask for photos/videos)
- FAQ and support links (anticipate common questions)
- Offer discount on next purchase or referral program

---

## Using Shopify Pre-Order Apps With Your Fulfillment Strategy

Your pre-order app should integrate with your fulfillment workflow. Here's how:

### **For Print-on-Demand / Dropship**

Use **Backorder Master** or **Hextom Pre-order Manager** + Printful/Dropify integration:
- Product is only made when pre-order closes or delivery date nears
- No inventory held; no cash tied up in stock
- Perfect for testing new products or limited editions

### **For Manufacturers / Custom Products**

Use **Preorder Manager** with deposit collection:
- Collect 50% deposit at pre-order to fund manufacturing
- Manufacture based on actual pre-order volumes (no guesswork)
- Collect final payment before shipment
- Coordinate with your production vendor using pre-order app's order data

### **For Retail Dropship**

Use **Presales** or **Hextom** with multi-channel sync:
- Check supplier availability before offering pre-order
- Sync pre-order inventory to supplier systems to prevent overselling
- Fulfill from supplier inventory when it arrives

---

## Growing Revenue With Pre-Orders

Pre-orders aren't just about selling existing products early. They're a lever for revenue growth:

**1. Test new products with zero inventory risk**
- Create a pre-order offering for a new variant or category
- If it doesn't hit minimum pre-order threshold, cancel and refund
- If it does, manufacture with full confidence

**2. Create scarcity and exclusivity**
- "Limited to 500 units" (then truly limit it)
- Drives urgency and FOMO
- Increases conversion rates 20–40% vs. unlimited in-stock products

**3. Build community around launches**
- Pre-order customers become your most engaged audience
- They've already committed financially and emotionally
- Perfect segment for VIP access, early feedback, community programs

**4. Extend selling season**
- Sell out-of-season products via pre-order (Christmas goods in September)
- Sell seasonal variants months in advance

---

## How to Choose Between These Apps

**Use Presales if:** You're running simple, occasional pre-orders for new product launches. You want the easiest setup and don't need advanced payment options.

**Use Preorder Manager if:** You're running multiple simultaneous pre-orders, need detailed analytics on pre-order profitability, or use flexible payment options (deposits, full payment, or payment plans).

**Use Hextom if:** You're selling on multiple channels (Shopify + Amazon), need to sync inventory across platforms, or run high volumes of pre-orders (100+/month).

**Use Backorder Master if:** You want to handle both planned pre-orders AND reactive backorders in one system, or you use print-on-demand or dropship fulfillment.

**Use Rush if:** You're launching a consumer product designed to go viral, want referral/social incentives, or have sophisticated email marketing (Klaviyo, Drip).

---

## Integrating Pre-Orders Into Your Shopify Pricing Strategy

Set pre-order pricing strategically. You have three options:

**1. Premium pricing**
- Pre-order price is higher than in-stock price (you're offering exclusive early access)
- Works for high-demand launches and limited editions
- Example: Sneaker pre-orders at $150 vs. in-stock price of $120

**2. Incentive pricing**
- Pre-order price is lower than eventual in-stock price (you're paying for validation and cash flow)
- Works for uncertain demand or long pre-order windows
- Example: Pre-order at $89 vs. in-stock at $99

**3. Neutral pricing**
- Pre-order price matches eventual in-stock price
- Removes price as a decision variable; focus is on delivery timeline and scarcity

Most successful pre-order campaigns use either premium or neutral pricing. Incentive pricing signals uncertainty, which can undermine confidence in the product.

---

## Common Pre-Order Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Surprise delays:** Set conservative estimated delivery dates and beat expectations. If you promise March 15 and ship February 28, customers feel delighted. If you promise March 15 and ship April 10, they're angry.

2. **Unclear cancellation policy:** Every customer asks, "Can I cancel if I change my mind?" Answer it upfront and explicitly in your pre-order page.

3. **Not automating email communication:** Manual updates don't scale. Your pre-order app should send milestone emails automatically. Customers who don't hear from you for two months assume you've forgotten them.

4. **Overselling inventory:** Use your app's inventory reservation feature religiously. Selling 1,000 pre-orders when you can only manufacture 800 is a disaster.

5. **Mixing pre-orders and in-stock on the same product:** Create separate product listings or use an app that clearly distinguishes the two. Customers get confused if they think they're buying in-stock and end up with a pre-order.

6. **Not tracking pre-order metrics:** Monitor conversion rates, refund rates, and average order value by pre-order campaign. This data informs future launches.

---

## Recommended Resources and Tools

Beyond pre-order apps, you'll want:

- **Email marketing platform:** Klaviyo, Drip, or Mailchimp for launch sequences and milestone emails
- **Analytics:** Shopify's native analytics + your pre-order app's dashboard
- **Landing page builder:** If using Rush or doing a major launch, consider Unbounce or Leadpages for standalone pre-order pages
- **A/B testing:** Test different messaging, pricing, and ship dates with Shopify's built-in A/B testing
