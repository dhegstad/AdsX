  - question: "How long does it take to complete a Shopify store launch?"
    answer: "A typical Shopify store launch takes 4-12 weeks depending on complexity. Stores with 50-200 products and a straightforward design can launch in 4-6 weeks. Larger catalogs (500+ products), custom integrations, or complex workflows require 8-12 weeks. The checklist helps you identify what's actually necessary versus nice-to-have, helping you prioritize the most critical items for launch and defer optimization tasks to post-launch."
  - question: "What are the most critical items on a Shopify launch checklist?"
    answer: "The absolute must-haves before launch are: a working checkout process with all payment gateways enabled, accurate product listings with real inventory counts, shipping methods configured correctly, legal pages (Terms of Service and Privacy Policy), SSL certificate enabled (HTTPS), a clear return/refund policy, and contact information. Missing any of these will result in either lost sales or legal liability. Everything else can be optimized post-launch, but these items will directly impact your store's ability to function and convert visitors."
  - question: "Should I do a soft launch or a full launch?"
    answer: "A soft launch is a best practice for most stores. Before going fully public, launch to a limited audience: existing customers, email list, beta testers, and social media followers. Use this 1-2 week period to identify and fix bugs, test payment processing with real transactions, validate shipping calculations, and gather early feedback. Then do your full marketing push for the official launch. This approach significantly reduces the risk of losing sales due to preventable issues."
  - question: "What's the difference between launch-ready and optimized?"
    answer: "Launch-ready means your store functions correctly: products display properly, checkout works, payments process, orders are fulfilled. An optimized store goes beyond functionality to include conversion optimization: fast loading times, compelling product descriptions, high-quality images, customer reviews, abandoned cart recovery, and email nurture sequences. Aim to be launch-ready on day one, then spend weeks 3-8 post-launch optimizing conversions and customer experience."
  - question: "Can I add items to my Shopify store after launch?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Launching with 50-100 carefully selected products is better than launching late with 500 products that haven't been properly optimized. You can add new products post-launch continuously. However, certain foundational elements should be in place before launch: all payment gateways enabled, shipping zones configured, tax settings established, and legal pages published. These foundational systems are difficult to change after launch without disrupting early customers."

## Common Launch Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Launching with incomplete product data**
Avoid listing products without clear descriptions, multiple images, or accurate prices. Incomplete product information kills conversions and creates customer support burden. Better to launch with 50 perfect products than 500 mediocre ones.

**Mistake 2: Unclear shipping costs**
Display shipping costs before checkout. Hidden shipping fees cause cart abandonment and customer frustration. Test shipping calculations in multiple regions before launch.

**Mistake 3: No clear return policy**
Customers hesitate to buy without understanding your return policy. Make it prominently visible and customer-friendly. A generous return policy (30+ days) reduces purchase hesitation and often increases sales more than the cost of returns.

**Mistake 4: Forgetting legal pages**
Terms of Service and Privacy Policy aren't optional. They protect your business legally and build customer trust. Use templates as starting points, then customize for your specific business.

**Mistake 5: Launching without testing**
Never assume everything works. Complete end-to-end testing on real devices and browsers. Test payment processing with actual transactions (refund test transactions afterward).

**Mistake 6: Poor mobile optimization**
Over 60% of e-commerce traffic is mobile. If your store doesn't work beautifully on phones, you're leaving revenue on the table. Test thoroughly on iOS and Android devices.

**Mistake 7: Underselling trust signals**
New stores have no reviews or reputation. Compensate by emphasizing: money-back guarantees, clear return policies, security badges, customer testimonials (even from soft launch), prominent contact information, and professional design.
