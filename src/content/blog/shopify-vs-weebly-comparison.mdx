faqs:
  - question: "Is Shopify better than Weebly for selling online?"
    answer: "Shopify and Weebly serve different purposes, so 'better' depends on your specific needs. Shopify is purpose-built for e-commerce and excels at scaling from 100 to 100,000+ products with advanced inventory management, payment processing, and app ecosystem support. Weebly is a general-purpose website builder with e-commerce features—ideal for small creators, service providers, or local businesses that need a simple online store as one part of their web presence. If selling products is your primary focus and you plan to grow, Shopify offers superior feature depth. If you need a simple store alongside content pages or a service listing, Weebly's all-in-one approach may be sufficient."
  - question: "How much does it cost to start with Shopify vs Weebly?"
    answer: "Weebly is generally cheaper to start: free plans exist (with Weebly branding), and paid plans begin at $12/month with e-commerce features. Shopify's entry point is $39/month (Basic plan), with no free tier. However, Shopify typically costs less over time because its app ecosystem means fewer third-party services you need to pay separately—many integrations are built-in or inexpensive. Weebly often requires more add-on purchases (email marketing, advanced analytics, payment processors) that offset the lower initial price. For a serious online business, Shopify's costs are usually lower at scale; for hobby projects or small local businesses, Weebly's price advantage is meaningful."
  - question: "Which platform has better design and customization options?"
    answer: "Shopify offers more sophisticated design customization through its Liquid template language (for developers) and a large ecosystem of premium themes with advanced features. Weebly has excellent drag-and-drop simplicity and modern design templates, but customization beyond what's built into themes requires coding knowledge and has less flexibility. If design is a competitive advantage for your brand or if you have specific customization requirements, Shopify's ecosystem offers more options. If you need something that looks professional immediately without technical knowledge, Weebly's templates are often faster to deploy and equally visually appealing for many use cases."
  - question: "Can I migrate from Weebly to Shopify if I outgrow my store?"
    answer: "Migration from Weebly to Shopify is possible but requires technical work—it is not a one-click process. You'll need to export products, customers, and order data from Weebly and import them into Shopify using tools like Matrixify or hiring a developer familiar with both platforms. Plan 1-4 weeks of migration time depending on your store size (50 products vs 5,000 products makes a huge difference). Shopify offers a built-in Weebly importer through some of its apps, but it typically requires manual cleanup and verification. The migration path exists but is non-trivial, which is why many growing stores prefer to start with Shopify from the beginning if they anticipate scaling."
  - question: "Which platform is better for SEO and AI shopping assistant visibility?"
    answer: "Shopify has inherent advantages for both SEO and AI shopping visibility because it is purpose-built for product data and integrates tightly with Google Merchant Center, structured data, and shopping feeds. Shopify apps make it easy to implement complete schema.org Product markup, manage dynamic XML sitemaps, and optimize for featured snippets. Weebly supports SEO and can generate proper structured data, but requires more manual configuration and offers fewer plug-and-play solutions. For AI shopping assistants like ChatGPT Shopping, Google Gemini, and Amazon Rufus, Shopify's built-in product data quality and merchant integrations make getting recommended easier. Weebly stores can still rank and get recommended, but require more careful manual optimization. If AI shopping visibility is part of your growth strategy, Shopify's ecosystem has clear advantages."

For small business owners, entrepreneurs, and creators deciding where to build an online store, the choice between Shopify and Weebly feels urgent and consequential. Both platforms promise to get you selling fast, but they approach the problem from fundamentally different directions.

Weebly is a website builder that added e-commerce as one of its capabilities. Shopify is an e-commerce platform that started with selling products and built everything around that focus. That distinction shapes every comparison—from pricing to design flexibility to scalability to the ecosystem available to you.

This guide breaks down exactly what Shopify and Weebly do well, where they fall short, and which one actually makes sense for your specific business. By the end, you'll know which platform to start with, what trade-offs you are accepting, and what to expect as your business grows.

## The Core Distinction: Website Builder vs E-commerce Platform

Before comparing features, pricing, or design, understand that Shopify and Weebly solve different problems.

**Weebly** is a **general-purpose website builder**. It lets you create pages (home, about, services, contact, blog), add content, manage email subscribers, host a store, and publish everything to the web from a single dashboard. E-commerce is one feature set among many. Weebly excels at giving non-technical people the ability to build attractive websites quickly without coding.

**Shopify** is a **dedicated e-commerce platform**. It starts with the assumption that your primary goal is selling products online. Everything from inventory management to payment processing to order fulfillment to marketing is built around that goal. Shopify has pages and blogging, but these are secondary features supporting the store, not the center of the platform.

This design philosophy difference cascades into nearly every comparison that follows.

### Who Each Platform is Built For

**Shopify** is ideal for:
- Brands and businesses whose primary revenue comes from selling products
- Stores that will eventually reach hundreds or thousands of products
- Sellers who need sophisticated inventory management, variants, and order processing
- Businesses planning to expand internationally with multi-currency and multi-language support
- Teams who will use specialized apps and integrations to optimize different aspects of the business

**Weebly** is ideal for:
- Small local businesses that need a website with an embedded store (florists, personal trainers, consultants with digital products)
- Creators selling a limited number of items or digital downloads
- Bloggers or content creators who want to monetize through a small shop
- Service-based businesses where the website is the marketing tool and the store is secondary
- Budget-conscious startups with very limited initial inventory

Now that distinction is clear, let's compare the actual feature sets, starting with what truly matters for e-commerce: the ability to manage products, take payments, and fulfill orders.

---

## E-commerce Feature Comparison: Inventory, Payments, and Fulfillment

### Product Management and Inventory

**Shopify wins decisively here.** Shopify's product management system is built to handle stores of any size, from 10 items to 100,000+. Key capabilities include:

- **Product variants at scale**: Create unlimited variants (size, color, material, etc.) with variant-specific pricing, inventory levels, weight, and SKU tracking.
- **Inventory synchronization**: Real-time inventory tracking across multiple channels (your store, Amazon, social media shops, physical locations) prevents overselling.
- **Advanced inventory features**: Low-stock alerts, inventory forecasting, landed cost tracking, and product transfer management for multi-location businesses.
- **Collections and organization**: Dynamic collections that automatically categorize products based on rules, bulk operations to edit hundreds of products simultaneously.
- **Product data structure**: Native support for structured product data (schema.org) that directly feeds Google Merchant Center, ChatGPT Shopping, and other AI shopping assistants.

**Weebly's product management** works fine for smaller stores (up to a few hundred items) but becomes cumbersome at scale. You can create products with variants and inventory tracking, but:

- Bulk product imports and updates require manual CSV work without a polished bulk editor
- Inventory synchronization across channels is not built-in
- Inventory alerts are basic compared to Shopify
- Product organization tools are simpler, making it harder to manage large catalogs

For a store selling under 100 products, Weebly's inventory system is adequate. For anything larger, Shopify's depth becomes essential.

### Payment Processing

Both platforms support major payment methods, but their approaches differ meaningfully.

**Shopify Payments** (Shopify's native payment processor):
- Rates: 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction (similar to competitors)
- No monthly fees for using Shopify Payments
- Automated settlement directly to your bank
- PCI compliance handled for you
- Works in 135+ countries with localized payment methods (iDEAL in Netherlands, Alipay in China, etc.)

**Weebly Payments** (powered by Stripe):
- Rates: 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction (identical to Shopify)
- Also handles internationally, though with less localization
- Works seamlessly since Weebly is Stripe-native

Both platforms also support third-party payment gateways (PayPal, Amazon Pay, Apple Pay, etc.), so you are not locked into one processor. Shopify's advantage is its deeper international payment support and merchant tools (like multi-currency checkout). Weebly is simpler to set up initially.

### Order Management and Fulfillment

**Shopify** excels at scale again. Its order management system includes:

- Detailed order status tracking with customer notifications
- Built-in shipping rate calculators (integrates with USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL)
- Fulfillment apps for automating warehouse operations
- Return and refund management with customizable policies
- Packing slips, invoices, and order documentation generation
- Multi-location order routing (automatically send orders to the closest warehouse)

**Weebly's** order management is functional but basic:

- Orders are tracked in a simple dashboard
- You manually select shipping rates or calculate them outside the platform
- Notifications to customers work, but customization is limited
- No built-in returns management system
- No app ecosystem for automating fulfillment

If you are shipping 50 orders a month, Weebly works. If you are shipping 500, Shopify's tools save hours per week in operational friction.

### Shipping and Fulfillment Apps

Shopify's advantage extends to its app ecosystem. Apps like **Printful**, **Oberlo**, **ShipStation**, and **Inventory Lab** integrate seamlessly with Shopify stores, automating print-on-demand, dropshipping, multi-warehouse fulfillment, and returns management.

Weebly has fewer fulfillment app integrations, which means more manual work or reliance on external tools that don't connect natively.

**Winner**: Shopify by a clear margin for any store planning serious growth.

## Pricing Comparison: Actual Total Cost

Let's move past the headline prices and look at the real cost of running a store on each platform.

### Shopify Pricing Tiers

| Plan | Monthly Cost | Transaction Fee | Key Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Basic** | $39 | 2.9% + 30¢ | Up to 3 staff accounts, basic reports, product variants |
| **Shopify** | $105 | 2.7% + 30¢ | Up to 15 staff accounts, advanced reports, multi-channel selling |
| **Advanced** | $399 | 2.5% + 30¢ | Up to 100 staff accounts, custom reporting, API access |
| **Plus** | $2,300+ | Negotiable | Enterprise features, dedicated support |

Additional costs:
- **Apps**: Average Shopify store pays $50-300/month on apps (email, analytics, inventory, marketing)
- **Theme**: Free themes available, but premium themes range $140-350 one-time
- **Shipping**: Discounted rates negotiated by Shopify, but you pay actual carrier fees ($3-40+ per shipment)

### Weebly Pricing Tiers

| Plan | Monthly Cost | E-commerce Features | Key Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Free** | $0 | Limited (5 products, Weebly branding) | Blog, basic pages, Weebly branding |
| **Connect** | $12 | Yes, full e-commerce | Unlimited products, custom domain, Stripe integration |
| **Pro** | $18 | Yes | Advanced SEO, password protection, member-only pages |
| **Business** | $38 | Yes | Professional email, abandoned cart recovery, advanced analytics |

Additional costs:
- **Apps/Integrations**: Fewer paid apps; most integrations are free or low-cost ($0-50/month typically)
- **Theme**: Free and premium themes ($0-49)
- **Premium domain**: $12/year for .com (included with Business plan)

### Total Cost Comparison

**Scenario 1: A beginner selling 20-50 products**

Weebly: $18-38/month + domain ($0-12) = **$18-50/month**
Shopify: $39/month + average apps ($75) + theme ($0-140 one-time) = **$114/month first year, $114+ ongoing**

**Weebly is cheaper** in this scenario—especially if you don't need advanced features.

**Scenario 2: A growing store selling 200-500 products**

Weebly: $38/month + basic apps ($20-40) = **$58-78/month**
Shopify: $39-105/month + apps ($100-150) + email marketing ($20-50) = **$159-255/month**

**Weebly is still cheaper**, but the feature gap is becoming a cost in lost operational efficiency.

**Scenario 3: A serious store selling 1,000+ products with growth ambitions**

Weebly: $38/month + apps ($50-100) + potential hosting upgrades ($40-100) = **$128-238/month**
Shopify: $105/month + apps ($150-300) + email/analytics ($50-100) + dedicated support = **$255-505/month**

**Shopify costs more**, but you are getting inventory management, shipping automation, and fulfillment integrations that prevent costly operational errors and save 10+ hours per week as your order volume grows.

**Verdict**: Weebly is cheaper upfront; Shopify costs less per order at scale and becomes cost-effective once you're processing 500+ orders per month. For pure cost-consciousness, Weebly wins. For best cost per unit sold, Shopify wins past a certain scale.

## Design Capabilities and Brand Customization

Your store's design is its first impression, competitive advantage, and the foundation of customer trust. How does each platform handle this?

### Shopify's Design Ecosystem

Shopify offers both simplicity and unlimited depth through its **Liquid templating language**.

**For non-technical users:**
- 100+ free and premium themes, many with drag-and-drop customization
- Theme customizer for changing colors, fonts, and layouts without coding
- Pre-built sections (hero banners, product grids, testimonials, email signup) that snap together
- Many modern themes are mobile-responsive and fast by default

**For developers or design-savvy users:**
- Full access to Liquid template language (Shopify's proprietary HTML/CSS templating engine)
- Direct file editing for complete customization
- Custom CSS and JavaScript support
- API access for building custom experiences
- Theme marketplace with thousands of premium themes ($140-350) designed by professionals

The result: Shopify stores range from "looks like a template" (because many do) to "custom-designed experiences indistinguishable from bespoke builds." Your design quality depends on your budget and willingness to invest, but Shopify doesn't limit your ceiling.

Notable Shopify theme developers: **Broadcast**, **Brooklyn**, **Dawn**, **Supply**, **Empire**. Premium themes from these developers often include professional product photography, layout flexibility, and conversion-focused design patterns.

### Weebly's Design Ecosystem

Weebly emphasizes **drag-and-drop simplicity and beautiful defaults**.

**For non-technical users:**
- 100+ themes, all visually modern and professionally designed
- Full drag-and-drop page editor—no coding required
- Responsive designs that work on mobile by default
- Fast setup (create a store in an afternoon)

**For developers:**
- Limited coding access compared to Shopify
- You can add custom HTML/CSS, but the editor is less flexible
- Smaller ecosystem of premium themes and add-ons
- API exists but is less mature and less frequently used than Shopify's

The result: Weebly stores tend to look professional immediately because Weebly's default designs are genuinely good. But customization beyond what the theme provides is harder. If you need a highly custom design, you'll either be limited by Weebly's constraints or forced to hire a developer to work around them.

### Design Verdict

**If you want a professional store immediately without touching code:** Weebly wins. Its out-of-the-box design quality is excellent.

**If you need significant customization or plan to evolve your design:** Shopify wins. Its ecosystem and template language support professional ambition.

**If budget is tight and you're okay with a template design:** Both are fine—pick whichever platform appeals to you otherwise.

## Scalability: What Happens as Your Business Grows?

The crucial difference between Shopify and Weebly emerges as you grow.

### Growing Product Inventory

Shopify: Can handle 100,000+ products without performance degradation. Bulk operations, advanced filtering, and inventory management remain responsive.

Weebly: Becomes slow and cumbersome past 1,000-2,000 products. The dashboard was not designed for managing at-scale catalogs.

### Growing Order Volume

Shopify: Built for high order volume. Handles 1,000s of orders per day. Fulfillment automation, batch processing, and detailed reporting make operations manageable.

Weebly: Dashboard gets sluggish above 100 orders/day. Manual order management becomes a bottleneck.

### Growing Traffic

Shopify: Designed for traffic spikes. Whether you get 1,000 visitors/month or 1,000,000, the platform scales automatically.

Weebly: Shared hosting means you're on Weebly's infrastructure. Traffic performance is generally good, but you're not controlling your own scalability.

### Growing Team

Shopify: Supports multiple staff accounts (3 on Basic, 15 on Shopify, 100 on Advanced) with granular permissions. You can hire a fulfillment manager, a marketing specialist, and an inventory coordinator, each with appropriate access.

Weebly: Limited staff account management. Growing teams find the collaboration tools insufficient.

### Growing Integration Needs

Shopify: 10,000+ apps in the app store. Want to connect your store to Klaviyo for email? Gorgias for customer support? ShipStation for fulfillment? Oberlo for dropshipping? All integrated natively.

Weebly: 500+ integrations available, but integration depth is lower. Many popular tools (like advanced accounting or fulfillment apps) either don't integrate or require custom development.

**Scalability Verdict**: If you're betting on growth, Shopify is unambiguously better. It's designed for you to start at 10 products and scale to 10,000 without hitting ceiling after ceiling. Weebly is designed for small to medium stores and that's where it shines.

---

## Specific Use Cases: When to Choose Each Platform

Rather than a generic "Shopify is better" conclusion, let's be specific about when each platform makes the most sense.

### Choose Shopify If:

- **You're selling physical products and shipping them.** Shopify's shipping integrations, inventory management, and fulfillment automation save hours per week once you're processing multiple orders daily.

- **You plan to scale beyond 500 products or 200 monthly orders.** Shopify is built for growth. Upgrading from Weebly at that point means migration costs and operational disruption.

- **You need to sell across multiple channels.** Weebly is single-channel (your store). Shopify lets you sync inventory and sell from your own store, Amazon, Etsy, Instagram, and TikTok Shop simultaneously.

- **You're planning an omnichannel strategy** (online store + physical retail locations). Shopify POS and multi-location inventory are essential.

- **You require app integrations for email marketing, accounting, analytics, or fulfillment.** Shopify's ecosystem is vastly larger.

- **You need to optimize for AI shopping assistants** (ChatGPT Shopping, Google Gemini, Amazon Rufus). Shopify has built-in tools for product data quality, schema markup, and merchant feeds that directly improve visibility.

- **Your business model depends on creating customer relationships and repeat orders.** Shopify's customer data tools, segmentation, and marketing automation are sophisticated.

- **You're raising capital or building investor confidence.** Investors expect DTC brands on Shopify, not Weebly.

**Example Shopify stores**: Athletic apparel (100+ products, multi-variant), tech gadgets (1,000+ SKUs, drop-shipping), software subscriptions with physical merchandise, established DTC brands.

### Choose Weebly If:

- **You're selling a small number of items (under 50 products).** Weebly's simpler interface is faster to set up and manage.

- **E-commerce is one part of a larger web presence.** You need a home page, about page, blog, services listing, and a small store. Weebly's all-in-one approach is ideal.

- **You're a service-based business selling digital products, courses, or limited physical items.** A consultant selling a course, a designer selling templates, a creator selling presets—Weebly works perfectly.

- **You're bootstrapped and every dollar matters initially.** Weebly's free or $12/month entry point is real. Shopify's minimum is $39/month, which compounds over years.

- **Your customers don't need sophisticated tracking or returns management.** The fewer operational complexities, the better Weebly works.

- **You want to build a brand website that happens to have a store**, not a store that happens to have web pages.

**Example Weebly stores**: Local florist selling bouquets, freelance coach selling a digital course, artist selling prints and merchandise, personal brand selling a single ebook.

---

## Payment Processing and Transaction Fees

Both platforms support diverse payment methods, but the cost structure matters if you're selling significant volume.

### Transaction Fees

- **Shopify Basic**: 2.9% + 30¢
- **Shopify Standard**: 2.7% + 30¢
- **Weebly**: 2.9% + 30¢ (Stripe default)

On a $100 order:
- Shopify Basic: $3.20 fee
- Weebly: $3.20 fee

On $100,000 in annual sales:
- Shopify Basic: $2,900 in fees
- Weebly: $2,900 in fees

**The fee difference emerges as you grow.** Upgrading Shopify to the Standard plan ($105/month) drops the percentage to 2.7%, saving $200/year on $100,000 in sales. At Shopify Plus ($2,300+/month), you negotiate custom rates. Weebly never negotiates—you're locked at 2.9%.

For most small stores, this difference is immaterial. For high-volume stores, Shopify's escalating discounts save money.

### International Payments

Shopify Payments supports 135+ countries with localized payment methods. If you're selling internationally, Shopify's native payment options reduce checkout friction.

Weebly supports international payments through Stripe but with less localization.

---

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and AI Visibility

Increasingly, the ability to be discovered by search engines and AI shopping assistants matters as much as the store itself.

### SEO Foundation

**Shopify:**
- Built-in XML sitemaps that auto-update
- Robust robots.txt management
- Automatic canonical tags to prevent duplicate content
- Full control over meta titles, descriptions, and URL structure
- Structured data (schema.org) can be added natively or via apps
- Fast Core Web Vitals by default on modern themes

**Weebly:**
- Also provides XML sitemaps and meta tag control
- SEO basics are covered adequately
- Structured data support exists but requires more manual setup
- Core Web Vitals performance is generally good but less automatic

**SEO Verdict**: Shopify has slight advantages in automation and ecosystem support, but Weebly is adequate for SEO.

### AI Shopping Assistant Visibility

This is where Shopify's e-commerce focus becomes powerful. AI shopping assistants like ChatGPT Shopping, Google Gemini, and Amazon Rufus depend on high-quality product data and merchant feeds.

**Shopify integrates natively with:**
- Google Merchant Center (syncs automatically)
- Google Shopping (seamless feed management)
- Facebook/Instagram Shop
- Amazon Sales Channel
- TikTok Shop

This means your Shopify product data feeds AI shopping assistants automatically. For Weebly, you manually manage merchant feeds and data sync.

If [you're optimizing for AI visibility](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624), Shopify's automatic product data flow to major shopping platforms is a significant operational advantage.

---

## Email Marketing and Customer Retention

The most profitable customers are repeat customers. Both platforms support email marketing, but differently.

**Shopify:**
- Built-in email marketing via Shopify Email (free up to 10,000 subscribers)
- Abandoned cart recovery (automatically email customers who didn't complete purchases)
- Post-purchase email sequences
- Integrates with every major email tool (Klaviyo, Gorgias, HubSpot)
- Customer segmentation for targeted emails

**Weebly:**
- Built-in email tools for basic campaigns
- Abandoned cart recovery available on Business plan
- Integrations exist but are less sophisticated
- Fewer segmentation options

For serious e-commerce, Shopify's email ecosystem (especially abandoned cart recovery) recovers significant revenue that would otherwise be lost. Weebly's capabilities are adequate for small stores but become limiting for serious email marketing.

---

## Analytics and Business Insights

Understanding your business requires solid analytics. Both platforms provide dashboards, but their depth differs.

**Shopify:**
- Detailed reports on sales, customers, products, marketing ROI
- Cohort analysis and customer lifetime value calculations
- Multi-channel attribution (see which channel (organic, paid, social) drove each sale)
- Custom reporting via apps
- Data export for analysis in Google Sheets or BI tools

**Weebly:**
- Basic sales and traffic reports
- Less detail on customer behavior and attribution
- Limited segmentation and cohort analysis
- Reports are less customizable

For growing stores, Shopify's analytics help you understand which products are profitable, which marketing channels work, and where to invest next. Weebly's reports are sufficient for "how much did I sell?" but not for "where should I optimize?"

---

## Customer Support and Community

Both platforms offer support, but the quality and responsiveness differ.

**Shopify:**
- 24/7 phone, email, and chat support (included on all plans)
- Extensive documentation and video tutorials
- Thriving community (Shopify Community forums with thousands of discussions)
- Specialist app developers and agencies available for hire
- Shopify Plus provides dedicated account management

**Weebly:**
- Support available via email and chat
- Good documentation and tutorials
- Smaller community (fewer third-party resources)
- Fewer available developers and agencies specializing in Weebly

If you get stuck on Shopify, finding help is easy—searching "Shopify [problem]" returns solutions. Weebly is smaller, so support resources are more limited.

---

## Migration Concerns: What If You Choose Wrong?

The fear driving this comparison for many people is: "What if I start with Weebly and outgrow it?"

**Migrating from Weebly to Shopify is possible but non-trivial:**

- Product data (names, descriptions, images, prices, variants) can be exported as CSV and imported into Shopify
- Customer data and order history can be exported but require manual cleanup
- The process typically takes 1-4 weeks depending on store size
- URL structure changes, which affects SEO (301 redirects help but still cause ranking fluctuations)
- App integrations must be reconfigured on Shopify
- Estimated cost: $500-2,000 if using a migration service, or 40-80 hours of your time

**The practical advice:** If you think there's a 50% chance you'll outgrow Weebly within 2 years, start with Shopify now. The $39/month difference ($468 over a year) is cheaper than migration costs and operational disruption later.

If you're genuinely uncertain whether you'll sell much at all, Weebly's free tier lets you test market fit without financial commitment.

## Real Cost Example: The Path to $50,000 Annual Revenue

To make this concrete, let's map out two stores reaching $50,000 in annual revenue.

**Weebly Store Path:**

Year 1 (Month 1-6, selling 0-100 items/month):
- Platform: $12/month = $72
- Apps: $15/month = $90
- Domain: $12/year = $12
- Tools/Email: $30/month = $180
- **Year 1 Total: $354**

Year 1 (Month 7-12, selling 100-150 items/month):
- Platform: $38/month = $228
- Apps: $40/month = $240
- Domain/Email: $50/month = $300
- **Year 1 (latter half): $768**

**Year 1 Total: $1,122**

Year 2 (sustained at 150-200 items/month):
- Platform: $38/month = $456
- Apps: $50/month = $600
- Email/Tools: $60/month = $720
- **Year 2 Total: $1,776**

**Weebly Path Total: $2,898 to reach $50K**

---

**Shopify Store Path:**

Year 1 (Month 1-6, selling 0-100 items/month):
- Platform Basic: $39/month = $234
- Apps: $100/month = $600
- Theme: $150 one-time = $150
- Domain: $12/year = $12
- **Year 1 (first half): $996**

Year 1 (Month 7-12, selling 100-150 items/month):
- Platform Basic: $39/month = $234
- Apps: $120/month = $720
- Email/Analytics: $40/month = $240
- **Year 1 (latter half): $1,194**

**Year 1 Total: $2,190**

Year 2 (upgrade to Standard at 150-200 items/month):
- Platform Standard: $105/month = $1,260
- Apps: $150/month = $1,800
- Email/Tools: $70/month = $840
- **Year 2 Total: $3,900**

**Shopify Path Total: $6,090 to reach $50K**

---

**The Verdict:** To reach $50K, Weebly costs about $2,300 less. But:

- Shopify's inventory automation and fulfillment tools save 5+ hours per week once you're at 200 orders/month
- Shopify's shipping integrations save 15-20% on shipping costs (via negotiated rates)
- Shopify's multi-channel selling (Amazon, social, etc.) adds 20-30% to top line

By Year 3, the operational efficiency and additional channel revenue likely make Shopify cheaper per dollar sold, even with higher platform costs.

---

## Making Your Decision: A Framework

To decide between Shopify and Weebly, answer these questions:

1. **What is your primary business model?**
   - Selling products = Shopify
   - Content/services with a store = Weebly

2. **How many products will you sell?**
   - Under 100 = Either works
   - 100-500 = Weebly still functional, Shopify better
   - 500+ = Shopify necessary

3. **What's your expected order volume?**
   - Under 50/month = Weebly fine
   - 50-200/month = Both work
   - 200+/month = Shopify strongly preferred

4. **Do you need multi-channel selling?** (Amazon, social, other platforms)
   - Yes = Shopify
   - No = Either works

5. **What's your budget constraint?**
   - Minimum possible = Weebly ($0-12/month)
   - Don't mind investing = Shopify ($39-105/month)

6. **Is this a long-term business or an experiment?**
   - Long-term/expecting growth = Shopify
   - Testing market fit = Weebly

7. **Do you plan to hire staff for fulfillment/support?**
   - Yes = Shopify (better team management)
   - No = Either works

## The Strategic Recommendation

**Start with Shopify if:**
- You're founding a DTC brand with growth ambitions
- You're serious about making this your primary income
- You want to avoid migration later
- You're selling physical products with inventory management needs

**Try Weebly if:**
- You're testing whether people will buy what you're selling
- You're a service provider adding a small shop to your web presence
- You're extremely cost-conscious in the first 6 months
- Your store will stay under 100 products indefinitely

**Actionable next step:** Go through one platform's free trial. Build a sample store with 10-20 of your actual products. See which interface feels natural and which platform's ecosystem makes sense for your business. Both platforms offer free trials—use them.

If you're ready to scale on Shopify, [start your free 14-day trial](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624) and build your first product listing. Experience the platform before committing.
