  - question: "How much does Shopify cost per month?"
    answer: "Shopify pricing ranges from $39/month for Basic to $399/month for Advanced. Shopify Plus starts at $2,300/month for enterprise businesses. All plans include hosting, SSL certificates, and 24/7 support, but differ in features like staff accounts, reporting, and transaction fees."
  - question: "What are Shopify's transaction fees?"
    answer: "If you use Shopify Payments, there are no additional transaction fees beyond credit card processing rates. If you use third-party payment gateways, Shopify charges 2% on Basic, 1% on Shopify, and 0.6% on Advanced plans. Plus negotiates custom rates."
  - question: "Is Shopify Basic enough for a new store?"
    answer: "Shopify Basic is sufficient for most new stores doing under $10,000/month in sales. It includes everything needed to launch: unlimited products, 24/7 support, discount codes, and abandoned cart recovery. Consider upgrading when you need professional reports, more staff accounts, or lower transaction fees."
  - question: "When should I upgrade from Shopify to Advanced?"
    answer: "Upgrade to Advanced when you're processing over $50,000/month in sales (transaction fee savings offset the cost), need advanced reporting and analytics, want to calculate duties and import taxes, or require up to 15 staff accounts. The breakeven point for transaction fees alone is around $683,000 in annual sales using third-party payments."
  - question: "What hidden costs should I know about with Shopify?"
    answer: "Beyond monthly fees, consider: paid themes ($180-350 one-time), premium apps ($10-500/month), transaction fees with non-Shopify Payments, custom domain ($14/year), email marketing beyond free tier, and additional staff accounts on Basic. Most stores spend $50-200/month on apps for reviews, email, and SEO."

Choosing the right Shopify plan can feel overwhelming. With four main pricing tiers—Basic, Shopify, Advanced, and Plus—each offering different features, transaction fees, and capabilities, making the wrong choice means either overpaying for features you don't need or hitting walls that limit your growth.

This guide breaks down everything you need to know about Shopify pricing in 2026, including the real costs most merchants overlook, when to upgrade between plans, and which tier makes the most sense for your specific business situation.

Let's explore what each plan offers and who it's best suited for.

## Shopify Basic Plan ($39/month)

The Basic plan is Shopify's entry-level offering, but don't let the name fool you—it includes everything most new e-commerce businesses need to launch and grow.

### What's Included in Basic

**Core E-commerce Features:**
- Unlimited products
- 24/7 chat and email support
- Sales channels (online store, social media, marketplaces)
- Manual order creation
- Discount codes and gift cards
- Free SSL certificate
- Abandoned cart recovery
- Shopify POS Lite for in-person sales

**Marketing & SEO:**
- Basic SEO features
- Customer segmentation
- Marketing automation
- Shopify Email (up to 10,000 emails/month free)

**Shipping:**
- Shipping discounts up to 77%
- Shipping labels
- Calculated shipping rates from carriers

### Basic Plan Limitations

While comprehensive, Basic has constraints that growing businesses will eventually outgrow:

- Only 2 staff accounts
- Basic analytics and reports (no professional reports)
- Higher credit card processing rates (2.9% + 30¢)
- 2% transaction fee on third-party payment gateways
- No international domains or market-specific pricing
- No estimated duties and import taxes

### Who Should Choose Basic?

**Ideal for:**
- New stores testing product-market fit
- Side hustles and hobby businesses
- Stores doing under $10,000/month in sales
- Solo entrepreneurs or small teams (2 or fewer people)
- Businesses primarily using Shopify Payments

**Consider upgrading when:**
- You need more than 2 staff accounts
- Monthly sales exceed $10,000 consistently
- You require professional reporting for decision-making
- Transaction fee savings would offset higher plan costs

### Real Monthly Cost Estimate for Basic

Here's what a typical Basic store actually pays monthly:

| Cost Category | Amount |
|--------------|--------|
| Shopify Basic | $39 |
| Domain (amortized) | $1.17 |
| Theme (one-time, amortized over 2 years) | $7.50 |
| Essential apps (reviews, email, SEO) | $50-100 |
| **Typical Total** | **$98-148** |

## Shopify Plan ($105/month)

The standard Shopify plan hits the sweet spot for growing businesses. It's the most popular choice for established stores that have proven their concept and need room to scale.

### What's Included in Shopify Plan

Everything in Basic, plus:

**Enhanced Features:**
- 5 staff accounts
- Professional reports
- Lower credit card rates (2.7% + 30¢)
- Reduced third-party transaction fees (1%)
- Shopify POS Pro available ($89/month per location)
- USPS Priority Mail Cubic pricing

**Improved Analytics:**
- Sales reports by channel, time, and staff
- Customer reports (first-time vs returning)
- Behavior reports
- Finance reports
- Product analytics

### Shopify Plan vs Basic: The Real Difference

The jump from $39 to $105 might seem steep, but the value compounds:

**Staff Account Math:**
If you need 3+ people accessing your store, Basic forces awkward workarounds like sharing logins (against Shopify TOS) or limiting who can help with orders.

**Reporting Value:**
Professional reports help you identify:
- Which products actually make money (after returns)
- Which marketing channels drive real revenue
- Customer lifetime value patterns
- Seasonal trends for inventory planning

**Transaction Fee Savings:**
For stores using third-party payment processors:
- Basic: 2% transaction fee
- Shopify: 1% transaction fee

The breakeven point is approximately $6,600/month in sales. Above that, Shopify plan saves you money even before considering other benefits.

### Who Should Choose Shopify Plan?

**Ideal for:**
- Stores doing $10,000-$50,000/month in sales
- Teams of 3-5 people needing store access
- Businesses requiring professional analytics
- Brands selling internationally (better reports help)
- Stores using non-Shopify payment gateways

**Consider upgrading when:**
- You need more than 5 staff accounts
- International sales require duties/taxes calculation
- You want the lowest possible transaction fees
- Monthly sales consistently exceed $50,000

## Shopify Advanced Plan ($399/month)

Advanced is built for high-volume merchants and growing brands with complex needs. The higher price tag pays for itself through lower fees and enterprise-grade features.

### What's Included in Advanced

Everything in Shopify plan, plus:

**Premium Features:**
- 15 staff accounts
- Custom report builder
- Lowest standard credit card rates (2.5% + 30¢)
- Minimal third-party fees (0.6%)
- Third-party calculated shipping rates
- Up to 10 inventory locations with enhanced management

**International Commerce:**
- International domains and subfolders
- Market-specific product pricing
- Estimated duties and import taxes at checkout
- Local currencies with auto-conversion

**Advanced Analytics:**
- Custom report creation
- Advanced filtering and segmentation
- Exportable data for BI tools
- Customer cohort analysis

### Advanced Plan ROI Calculation

For stores using Shopify Payments, the credit card processing savings alone can justify Advanced:

**Monthly Sales: $100,000**
- Shopify plan rate: 2.7% = $2,700
- Advanced rate: 2.5% = $2,500
- Monthly savings: $200

At $100,000/month, you save $200 on processing but pay $294 more for the plan ($399 vs $105). Not quite worth it for processing alone.

**Breakeven Point:**
Advanced becomes cost-effective at approximately $147,000/month in sales when considering only credit card processing differences. However, the value of custom reports, international features, and more staff accounts often justifies the upgrade earlier.

For third-party payment gateways, the math shifts dramatically:

**Monthly Sales: $100,000 with third-party payments**
- Shopify plan fee: 1% = $1,000
- Advanced fee: 0.6% = $600
- Monthly savings: $400

Now you're ahead by $106/month ($400 savings - $294 plan difference).

### Who Should Choose Advanced?

**Ideal for:**
- Stores doing $50,000+/month in sales
- Businesses with significant international customers
- Teams requiring 6-15 people with store access
- Data-driven brands needing custom reports
- Companies using third-party payment processors at volume
- Merchants needing real-time carrier shipping rates

**Consider upgrading to Plus when:**
- You need more than 15 staff accounts
- Sales consistently exceed $500,000/month
- You require dedicated account management
- Advanced automation and customization is necessary
- You need multiple expansion stores

## Shopify Plus (Starting at $2,300/month)

[Shopify Plus](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624) is Shopify's enterprise solution, designed for high-growth brands and established companies with complex requirements.

### What's Included in Plus

**Enterprise Features:**

**Variable Pricing Factors:**

- Brands doing $1M+ annually (often $500K+/month)

**Indicators You're Ready for Plus:**
- You're hitting API rate limits
- Checkout customization would significantly improve conversion
- You need automated workflows across systems
- Standard support response times aren't adequate
- You're launching in multiple countries with separate stores

## Transaction Fees Deep Dive

Transaction fees are often the most misunderstood aspect of Shopify pricing. Let's clarify exactly what you pay.

### Shopify Payments Credit Card Rates

If you use Shopify Payments (powered by Stripe), you pay only the credit card processing rate:

| Plan | Online Rate | In-Person Rate |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Basic | 2.9% + 30¢ | 2.7% + 0¢ |
| Shopify | 2.7% + 30¢ | 2.5% + 0¢ |
| Advanced | 2.5% + 30¢ | 2.4% + 0¢ |
| Plus | 2.15% + 30¢ | 2.15% + 0¢ |

**No additional transaction fees with Shopify Payments.**

### Third-Party Payment Gateway Fees

If you use PayPal, Stripe directly, or another gateway, Shopify charges an additional transaction fee on top of whatever your payment processor charges:

| Plan | Additional Fee |
|------|---------------|
| Basic | 2.0% |
| Shopify | 1.0% |
| Advanced | 0.6% |
| Plus | 0.2% |

This means a $100 order on Basic with PayPal might cost you:
- PayPal rate: ~2.9% + 30¢ = $3.20
- Shopify fee: 2% = $2.00
- **Total: $5.20 (5.2%)**

Compared to Shopify Payments on Basic:
- Shopify Payments: 2.9% + 30¢ = $3.20
- **Total: $3.20 (3.2%)**

### When Third-Party Gateways Make Sense

Despite the extra fees, some situations warrant alternative payment processors:

- PayPal checkout for buyer trust and higher conversion
- Specific regional payment methods (Klarna, Afterpay, local options)
- Existing merchant relationships with better rates
- Multi-currency requirements in unsupported Shopify Payments countries

For most merchants, using Shopify Payments as primary and offering PayPal as secondary is the optimal balance of cost and conversion.

## Hidden Costs to Consider

Beyond the monthly subscription and transaction fees, budget for these commonly overlooked expenses:

### 1. Theme Costs

**Free Themes:**
Shopify offers ~12 free themes that work well for most stores.

**Premium Themes:**
More sophisticated designs cost $180-$400 one-time. Worth it if you need:
- Advanced customization options
- Specific features (mega menus, advanced filtering)
- Industry-specific designs
- Better performance optimization

### 2. App Costs

The Shopify App Store is where costs add up quickly. Typical monthly app spend:

| App Category | Typical Cost | Popular Options |

| Reviews | $15-100/mo | Judge.me, Loox, Stamped |
| Email Marketing | $0-200/mo | Klaviyo, Omnisend |
| SEO | $20-80/mo | SEO Manager, Plug in SEO |
| Upsells/Cross-sells | $20-80/mo | ReConvert, Bold |

| Subscription | $50-500/mo | Recharge, Bold Subscriptions |
| Loyalty Programs | $50-200/mo | Smile.io, LoyaltyLion |

**Average app spend by store size:**
- New stores: $50-100/month
- Growing stores: $100-300/month
- Established stores: $300-800/month

### 3. Domain Name

Shopify provides a free myshopify.com subdomain, but you'll want your own domain:
- Through Shopify: $14-40/year
- External registrar: $10-20/year (then connect to Shopify)

### 4. Email Hosting

Shopify Email includes 10,000 emails/month free. Beyond that:
- Additional Shopify Email: $1 per 1,000 emails

### 5. Developer/Designer Costs

For custom work:
- Theme customization: $500-5,000

- Professional shoot: $25-100 per product

## Comparing Shopify to Alternatives

While [Shopify](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624) dominates e-commerce, understanding alternatives helps ensure it's right for you:

### Shopify vs WooCommerce

| Factor | Shopify | WooCommerce |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Hosting** | Included | Self-hosted |
| **Monthly Cost** | $39-399 | $0 (plus hosting $20-100) |
| **Ease of Use** | Very easy | Moderate learning curve |
| **Customization** | Limited to themes/apps | Unlimited with development |
| **Security** | Managed | Your responsibility |
| **Best For** | Most merchants | Developers, existing WordPress sites |

### Shopify vs BigCommerce

| Factor | Shopify | BigCommerce |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Monthly Cost** | $39-399 | $39-399 |
| **Transaction Fees** | 0-2% (third-party) | None |
| **Staff Accounts** | 2-15 | Unlimited |
| **App Ecosystem** | Larger | Smaller but growing |
| **Best For** | Most merchants | High-volume, multi-channel |

### Shopify vs Wix eCommerce

| Factor | Shopify | Wix |
|--------|---------|-----|
| **Monthly Cost** | $39-399 | $29-59 |
| **E-commerce Focus** | Primary focus | Secondary to website builder |
| **Advanced Features** | Comprehensive | Limited |

## Money-Saving Tips

### 1. Pay Annually

Save 25% by paying yearly:
- Basic: $29/mo (vs $39 monthly)
- Shopify: $79/mo (vs $105 monthly)
- Advanced: $299/mo (vs $399 monthly)

Annual savings: $120-$1,200 depending on plan.

### 2. Use Shopify Payments

Avoid the 0.6-2% third-party transaction fees entirely. For a store doing $50,000/month on Basic with third-party payments, switching to Shopify Payments saves $1,000/month.

### 3. Audit App Usage

Monthly app audit questions:
- Is this app providing ROI?
- Am I using all features, or could I downgrade?
- Does Shopify now offer this natively?
- Can one app replace two others?

Many stores waste $100+/month on unused or redundant apps.

### 4. Start with Free Themes

Premium themes are nice, but free themes like Dawn work excellently. Master free before paying for premium.

### 5. Negotiate Plus Pricing

Plus pricing is negotiable. Leverage:
- Multi-year commitments
- High volume projections
- Competitive offers from BigCommerce or others
- Clean migration from competitor platforms

## Frequently Asked Questions

The most common questions about Shopify pricing, answered in detail:

### Can I start with Basic and upgrade later?

Absolutely. Shopify makes upgrading seamless—all your data, products, customers, and settings transfer automatically. Most successful stores start on Basic and upgrade as they grow. The only consideration is that some apps may have different pricing tiers based on your Shopify plan.

### Does Shopify charge for sales taxes?

No. Shopify doesn't take a cut of sales tax you collect. However, calculating and remitting sales tax is your responsibility. Shopify's built-in tax settings handle basic calculations, but complex situations may require apps like TaxJar or Avalara ($20-500/month).

### Is Shopify Payments available in my country?

Shopify Payments is available in: United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Netherlands, and several others. Check Shopify's current list, as they regularly add countries.

### What happens if I exceed my plan's limits?

Shopify doesn't charge overages for most limits—you simply won't be able to add more (like staff accounts). For API calls on Plus, exceeding limits may temporarily throttle your integrations. There's no automatic upgrade or surprise charges.

### Can I downgrade my plan?

Yes. You can downgrade at any time, effective at your next billing cycle. Be aware that you'll lose access to higher-tier features immediately, and some apps tied to those features may stop working.
