  - question: "Is Shopify or BigCommerce better for beginners?"
    answer: "Shopify is generally better for beginners due to its more intuitive interface and extensive app ecosystem. The drag-and-drop editor is easier to use, and there are more tutorials and resources available. BigCommerce has a steeper learning curve but offers more built-in features without requiring apps."
  - question: "Which platform is cheaper, Shopify or BigCommerce?"
    answer: "BigCommerce often has a lower total cost of ownership because many features that require paid apps on Shopify are built-in. However, Shopify's Basic plan starts at $29/month versus BigCommerce's Standard at $29/month. Factor in apps and transaction fees when calculating your actual costs."
  - question: "Can I sell B2B on Shopify and BigCommerce?"
    answer: "Both platforms support B2B selling, but BigCommerce has stronger native B2B features including customer groups, custom pricing, and quote management. Shopify requires B2B apps or the Shopify Plus tier ($2,000+/month) for equivalent functionality."
  - question: "Which platform is better for SEO?"
    answer: "BigCommerce offers more built-in SEO features including customizable URLs, automatic sitemap generation, and CDN-delivered pages. Shopify also provides solid SEO capabilities but may require apps for advanced features. Both platforms can rank well with proper optimization."
  - question: "Can I migrate from Shopify to BigCommerce or vice versa?"
    answer: "Yes, both platforms support migration. BigCommerce offers free migration services and tools specifically designed to import from Shopify. Shopify also has migration apps available. The process typically takes a few days to weeks depending on catalog size and customizations."

Choosing the right e-commerce platform is one of the most critical decisions you will make for your online business. In 2026, two platforms dominate the hosted e-commerce landscape: **Shopify** and **BigCommerce**. Both power millions of online stores, but they take fundamentally different approaches to helping merchants succeed.

This comprehensive comparison examines every aspect of both platforms to help you make an informed decision for your business.

## Platform Overview

### What is Shopify?

[**Shopify**](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624) is the world's leading e-commerce platform, powering over 4 million online stores globally. Founded in 2006 in Ottawa, Canada, Shopify has grown from a simple online store builder to a comprehensive commerce ecosystem that handles everything from point-of-sale to international expansion.

Shopify's philosophy centers on simplicity and ecosystem. The core platform provides essential e-commerce functionality, while the Shopify App Store offers over 8,000 apps to extend capabilities. This modular approach lets merchants start simple and add features as they grow.

**Key Shopify statistics (2026):**

### What is BigCommerce?

**BigCommerce** is an enterprise-focused e-commerce platform known for its robust built-in features and headless commerce capabilities. Founded in 2009 in Austin, Texas, BigCommerce targets mid-market and enterprise merchants who need powerful functionality without heavy customization.

BigCommerce's philosophy emphasizes native features over third-party apps. The platform includes advanced SEO tools, multi-channel selling, and B2B capabilities out of the box. This all-in-one approach reduces reliance on apps but can feel more complex for beginners.
