  - question: "Is Shopify better than Squarespace for selling products?"
    answer: "Shopify is generally better for dedicated e-commerce businesses due to its advanced inventory management, multi-channel selling, and extensive app ecosystem.

Both platforms still pass through standard credit card processing fees."
  - question: "Do I need coding skills to use Shopify or Squarespace?"
