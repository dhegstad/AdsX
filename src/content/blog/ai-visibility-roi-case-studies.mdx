    answer: "Based on our case studies, companies typically see 150-500% ROI within the first year. Results vary by industry, competition level, and existing content quality.

  - question: "How do companies track AI visibility ROI?"
    answer: "Successful companies use a combination of direct tracking (AI platform referrals), post-purchase surveys, brand search lift analysis, and share of voice monitoring. The key is establishing baseline metrics before optimization and consistently tracking changes over time."

## Common Success Patterns

Across all five case studies, several patterns emerged:

### 1. Differentiation Over Competition

The most successful companies didn't try to out-compete market leaders head-on. Instead, they identified underserved niches, specific use cases, or unique angles where they could dominate.

### 2. Education Creates Authority

Companies that invested in genuine educational content—not just product marketing—saw higher share of voice and better conversion rates.

### 3. Consistency Compounds

All successful cases involved consistent effort over 6+ months. There were no overnight successes, but results compounded over time.

### 4. Multi-Channel Measurement

No single metric captured the full picture. Successful companies combined direct tracking, surveys, and proxy metrics for accurate attribution.

### 5. Quality Over Quantity

Fewer, better pieces of content outperformed high-volume, low-quality approaches. AI systems reward depth and authority.

## Getting Started

These case studies show that significant AI visibility ROI is achievable across industries. The key elements are:

1. **Clear differentiation** - Know what makes you uniquely recommendable
2. **Quality content** - Invest in genuinely helpful, comprehensive content
3. **Consistent effort** - Plan for 6+ months of sustained work
4. **Proper measurement** - Set up tracking before you start
5. **Iterative improvement** - Learn from data and optimize continuously
