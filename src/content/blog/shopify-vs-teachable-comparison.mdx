faqs:
  - question: "Is Shopify better than Teachable for selling courses?"
    answer: "Neither is universally better—it depends on your needs. Shopify excels at selling physical products alongside courses and offers more flexibility for customization and integrations. Teachable is purpose-built for course creators with superior course functionality, student progress tracking, and built-in learning features. Choose Shopify if you're selling mixed product types; choose Teachable if courses are your primary focus."
  - question: "Can Shopify handle course delivery as well as Teachable?"
    answer: "Shopify can deliver courses through apps and integrations, but it requires additional setup. Teachable has native course features including video hosting, lesson progression, quizzes, certifications, and student engagement tools built into the platform. For serious course creators, Teachable's purpose-built features provide a better student experience and require less technical configuration."
  - question: "Which platform is cheaper for digital product sales?"
    answer: "Shopify's pricing starts at $39/month with 30% transaction fees on digital products. Teachable's Creator plan starts at $99/month with 10% transaction fees. For low-volume sales, Shopify may be cheaper; for higher-volume courses, Teachable's lower fees often make it more economical. Consider your average order value and transaction volume when calculating total cost of ownership."
  - question: "Can I use both Shopify and Teachable together?"
    answer: "Yes, many creators use both platforms strategically. Run your main course business on Teachable, while using Shopify to sell physical merchandise, digital products, or bundled offerings. You can integrate them using Zapier or custom APIs to synchronize customer data. Some use Teachable for courses and Shopify for a broader e-commerce presence."
  - question: "What if I want to sell both courses and physical products?"
    answer: "Shopify is the better choice if you're heavily focused on physical products with courses as a secondary offering. Teachable works if courses are primary and you're selling limited physical products (merchandise, bundles). For optimal results with equal emphasis on both, consider using Teachable for courses and a Shopify store for physical products, linked together through your website."

Choosing the right platform for selling courses and digital products is one of the most important decisions an online entrepreneur can make. Two platforms dominate this space: **Shopify** and **Teachable**. While both enable you to sell digital content, they approach the problem very differently, and choosing the wrong one could mean struggling with features you need or paying more than necessary.

Shopify is a general-purpose e-commerce platform that can sell almost anything—physical products, digital files, subscriptions, and courses. Teachable is purpose-built specifically for course creators, with native features for student management, learning progress, certificates, and engagement.

This comprehensive guide breaks down both platforms across every important dimension: features, pricing, capabilities, and use cases. By the end, you'll know exactly which platform—or combination of platforms—is right for your business.

## Understanding the Core Differences

Before diving into specific features, it's crucial to understand the fundamental difference in how these platforms approach your business.

### Shopify: The General E-commerce Platform

Shopify is built to be a complete e-commerce solution for any type of product or service. It's a shopping cart platform that lets you sell physical products, digital downloads, subscriptions, and yes, courses. However, it's not specialized for any one of these categories.

**Shopify's philosophy:** Flexibility and integration. You can build nearly anything on Shopify, but you often need third-party apps to unlock advanced features.

### Teachable: The Purpose-Built Course Platform

Teachable was specifically designed for online course creators. Every feature, every workflow, and the entire platform architecture revolves around the needs of educators and course creators.

**Teachable's philosophy:** Specialization and simplicity. Everything you need to run a successful course business is built-in and ready to use.

These different philosophies create very different experiences for different business types.

## Course Platform Features: Deep Dive

If your primary business is selling courses, this is the most important section.

### Course Structure and Content Delivery

**Teachable:**
- Native support for course organization (modules, lessons, sections)
- Built-in video hosting with adaptive streaming
- Support for multiple content types: videos, text lessons, audio, downloadable resources
- Drip-feed content to control when students access lessons
- Prerequisite management (students must complete lesson X before accessing lesson Y)
- Student progress tracking across all courses
- Time-based and completion-based course access rules
- Discussions and Q&A forums per course

**Shopify:**
- No native course structure—you need third-party apps
- Popular apps: Podia, Kajabi integration, or custom solutions
- Limited video hosting—typically upload to external platforms (Vimeo, YouTube) or use integrated apps
- Basic content delivery through digital downloads
- No built-in progress tracking without apps
- No native discussion forums or engagement features
- Requires more manual setup and configuration

**Winner for Courses: Teachable.** The native course structure means your students experience a true learning platform, not a converted e-commerce checkout.

### Student Engagement and Community

**Teachable:**
- Built-in discussion forums for each course
- Student-to-student and instructor-to-student interaction
- Course announcements sent directly to enrolled students
- Progress notifications and completion certificates
- Performance tracking and reporting

- Native email integration with student progress triggers

**Shopify:**
- No native student engagement features
- You'd need to manage discussions in external tools (Slack, Discord, Facebook Groups)
- Email marketing requires integration with third-party tools
- No built-in certification system
- Limited ability to track student engagement with content

**Winner for Courses: Teachable.** Community and engagement features are table-stakes for course platforms.

### Assessments and Certifications

**Teachable:**

- Question randomization and answer key shuffling
- Conditional logic based on quiz results
- Automatic grading with customizable passing scores
- Native certificate generation upon course completion
- Personalized certificates with student names and completion dates
- Printable and digital certificates
- Certificate verification system for employers

**Shopify:**

- Would need custom development or external tools for certificates

**Winner for Courses: Teachable.** If credentialing and assessments matter to your students, Teachable wins decisively.

## Digital Product Features

Both platforms can sell digital products like ebooks, templates, software, or downloadable content. Here's how they compare:

### Product Setup and Management

**Shopify:**
- Simple digital product creation
- Instant download delivery after purchase

- Can use products to supplement course offerings

**Comparison:** Shopify has a slight edge for pure digital product sales due to more flexible bundling and variant options. However, both platforms deliver files reliably.

- Files up to 4 GB
- Unlimited number of digital products

**Teachable:**

### Product Variants and Customization

**Shopify:**
- Advanced product variants (size, color, format, delivery method)
- Personalization options
- Pre-orders with conditional pricing
- Different pricing for different customer groups

**Teachable:**

## Physical Product Capabilities

If you plan to sell any physical products (merchandise, physical books, equipment), this section matters significantly.

### Physical Inventory Management

**Shopify:**
- Full inventory tracking across multiple locations
- Stock level alerts and automatic reordering
- SKU management and barcode support
- Inventory forecasting tools (advanced plans)
- Multi-warehouse support
- Return and exchange management
- Inventory syncing with other sales channels

**Teachable:**

**Winner for Physical Products: Shopify.** This is one area where Shopify is clearly superior.

### Shipping and Fulfillment

**Shopify:**
- Native shipping integration with major carriers
- Real-time shipping rate calculation
- Branded shipping labels
- Multi-carrier support (FedEx, UPS, USPS, DHL)
- Carrier selection by weight and destination
- Discounted shipping rates through Shopify partnerships
- Fulfillment center integrations (Amazon FBA, 3PLs)
- Returns and exchanges management

**Teachable:**
- No shipping features at all
- Assumes digital delivery

**Comparison:** If physical shipping is part of your business, Shopify is the only viable option between these two.

## Pricing Comparison

This is where many creators make their platform decision. Let's break down total cost of ownership across different scenarios.

### Platform Subscription Fees

**Shopify:**
- Basic plan: $39/month
- Shopify plan: $105/month
- Advanced plan: $399/month
- Plus plan: $2,300/month
- Includes unlimited bandwidth, SSL certificate, 24/7 support

**Teachable:**
- Free plan: $0/month (limited features, includes transaction fees)
- Creator plan: $99/month (1 course, 1,000 students max)
- Pro plan: $199/month (unlimited courses, 10,000 students max)
- Business plan: $499/month (unlimited everything)
- Annual discounts available (10-20% savings)

### Transaction Fees

This is critical—it's where the total cost can diverge significantly.

**Shopify:**
- Basic plan: 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction
- Shopify plan: 2.7% + 30¢ per transaction
- Advanced plan: 2.5% + 30¢ per transaction
- **Digital products specifically:** 6% + 30¢ (higher than physical)

**Teachable:**
- Creator plan and above: 10% per transaction
- Payment processor fees (Stripe/PayPal): separate ~2.2% + $0.30
- Total typical transaction cost: ~12% + fees

### Total Cost Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Selling 50 courses per month at $50 each = $2,500 revenue**

Shopify Basic Plan:
- Platform: $39/month
- Digital product fees: 6% ($150) + transaction fees ($15)
- **Total: ~$204/month (8.2%)**

Teachable Creator Plan:
- Platform: $99/month
- Transaction fees: 10% ($250) + payment processor 2.2% ($55)
- **Total: ~$404/month (16.2%)**

**Winner: Shopify for this volume.**

**Scenario 2: Selling 300 courses per month at $50 each = $15,000 revenue**

Shopify Basic Plan:
- Platform: $39/month
- Digital product fees: 6% ($900) + transaction fees (~$90)
- **Total: ~$1,029/month (6.9%)**

Teachable Pro Plan:
- Platform: $199/month
- Transaction fees: 10% ($1,500) + payment processor 2.2% ($330)
- **Total: ~$2,029/month (13.5%)**

**Winner: Shopify still wins on percentage, but Teachable's built-in features may justify the cost.**

**Scenario 3: Selling $50,000/month in courses and digital products**

Shopify Advanced Plan:
- Platform: $399/month
- Digital product fees: 6% ($3,000) + transaction fees (~$300)
- **Total: ~$3,699/month (7.4%)**

Teachable Business Plan:
- Platform: $499/month
- Transaction fees: 10% ($5,000) + payment processor 2.2% (~$1,100)
- **Total: ~$6,599/month (13.2%)**

**Winner: Shopify, but Teachable's features may justify the cost difference for course-focused businesses.**

### Cost Comparison Takeaway

For pure digital product and course sales, **Shopify's transaction fees are significantly lower** (6% + 30¢ vs 12%+). However, Teachable's built-in course features mean you're not paying for third-party course apps on Shopify. When you factor in course platform apps (Podia, LMS integrations), the total cost gap narrows considerably.

At scale, Shopify's lower transaction fees make a real financial difference. At smaller scales, the convenience of Teachable's built-in features is often worth the higher cost.

## When to Use Shopify vs Teachable

Your choice should ultimately depend on your specific business model and priorities.

### Choose Shopify If You:

1. **Sell physical products primarily**, even if courses are secondary
2. **Anticipate high volume sales** where transaction fees matter significantly
3. **Want maximum customization and control** over your platform
4. **Plan to integrate with multiple business systems** (inventory, accounting, CRM)
5. **Are building a broad e-commerce empire** beyond just courses
6. **Have technical skills** or can hire developers for customization
7. **Want unlimited scalability** without hitting platform limitations
8. **Prefer a marketplace app approach** to adding features

With [Shopify's flexible platform](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624), you can start simple and add complexity as your business grows. The platform supports everything from a simple digital product store to a multi-channel e-commerce empire.

### Choose Teachable If You:

1. **Sell courses as your primary business model**
2. **Want a purpose-built student learning experience**
3. **Need built-in community and engagement features**
4. **Prefer a simple setup with minimal technical configuration**
5. **Value complete student lifecycle management**
6. **Want built-in certification and assessment tools**
7. **Plan to have fewer than 10,000 students per course**
8. **Appreciate a platform designed specifically for educators**

### Use Both Platforms If You:

This is increasingly common for multi-product businesses:

1. **Run your main course business on Teachable** for the superior course features and student experience
2. **Run a complementary Shopify store** for physical merchandise, digital products, or a broader e-commerce presence
3. **Connect them through Zapier or custom APIs** to sync customer data and create a unified experience

For example, a personal development coach might run their signature course on Teachable while selling merchandise, books, and supplementary digital products through [Shopify](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624).

## Implementation Considerations

Beyond features and pricing, consider these practical factors:

### Learning Curve

**Shopify:** Steeper if you're not familiar with e-commerce. Requires learning dashboard, apps, and potentially liquid coding.

**Teachable:** Gentler. Designed for creators without technical backgrounds. Most features are self-explanatory.

### Time to Launch

**Shopify:** 2-4 weeks to launch a professional store (with app configuration)

**Teachable:** 3-7 days to launch a functional course platform

### Support and Community

**Shopify:** Massive community, extensive documentation, numerous agencies and freelancers

**Teachable:** Smaller but passionate community, good documentation, responsive support

### Migration Path

If you start on Teachable and outgrow it, migrating to Shopify requires exporting student data and rebuilding course structures. Plan for this possibility if you anticipate significant growth.

## Making Your Final Decision

Start by asking yourself these questions:

1. **What's my primary revenue driver?** (Courses, physical products, digital downloads, or mixed)
2. **How many customers do I expect in year one?** (Affects transaction fee impact)
3. **How important is course functionality vs. general e-commerce?**
4. **What's my technical comfort level?**
5. **Do I plan to expand beyond my current product mix?**

If you're primarily focused on courses and simplicity matters, **Teachable is likely your best choice**. You get everything built-in and can launch quickly.

If you're building a broader e-commerce presence, selling physical products, or anticipating significant scale, **Shopify is the better long-term investment**. You'll save substantially on transaction fees and have unlimited flexibility as your business evolves.

Many successful creators use both platforms strategically, and that's perfectly valid. The key is choosing the platform that your core business relies on.
