"What's the best payment processing solution for a marketplace?" "Which lending platform works best for small business loans?" "What core banking system should a digital bank use?" These questions are increasingly asked of AI assistants rather than searched on Google.

For fintech companies and financial software providers, appearing in these AI-generated recommendations has become critical for growth. This guide explains how fintech companies can optimize their AI visibility while navigating the unique requirements of the financial services industry.

## The Fintech Discovery Landscape

The fintech sector combines technology innovation with heavily regulated financial services. This creates unique dynamics for software discovery and vendor selection.

### How Financial Decisions Makers Research Solutions

Traditional fintech discovery involved:
- RFP processes and formal evaluations
- Analyst reports from Gartner, Forrester, and financial specialists
- Industry conferences and vendor relationships
- Compliance and legal review processes
- Extended proof of concept periods

AI-assisted discovery now often begins with:
- Asking AI about fintech categories and options
- Querying about specific use case solutions
- Understanding regulatory requirements
- Creating initial shortlists before formal RFP
- Comparing solutions at a high level

### Why Fintech AI Visibility Matters

Despite longer sales cycles and formal processes, the initial discovery phase shapes which vendors even get considered:

- Financial decision makers use AI for preliminary research
- AI recommendations influence which vendors make RFP lists
- AI helps frame evaluation criteria and key questions
- Vendors not in AI recommendations face uphill battles
