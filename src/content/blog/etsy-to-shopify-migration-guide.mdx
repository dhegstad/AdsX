faqs:
  - question: "When should I migrate from Etsy to Shopify?"
    answer: "Consider migrating when you hit $50,000+ annual revenue, have 20%+ repeat customers, receive brand-specific searches, feel limited by Etsy's policies, or when Etsy fees exceed 15% of your revenue. These signals indicate you've built enough brand equity to drive your own traffic and would benefit from owning your customer relationships."
  - question: "How much does Shopify cost compared to Etsy fees?"
    answer: "At $100,000 annual revenue, Etsy takes approximately $15,200 in fees (15.2%) while Shopify Basic costs around $5,400 (5.4%) including subscription and payment processing. The savings increase with revenue. At $250,000/year, you save roughly $21,000 annually by being on Shopify instead of Etsy."
  - question: "Can I run Etsy and Shopify at the same time?"
    answer: "Yes, and this is the recommended approach. Run both platforms simultaneously during your transition period (typically 6-12 months). Use Etsy for discovery while directing repeat customers to your Shopify store. Include inserts in Etsy orders promoting your website, and gradually shift marketing spend toward your own store."
  - question: "Will I lose traffic if I leave Etsy?"
    answer: "You'll lose access to Etsy's built-in marketplace traffic, which is the main trade-off. However, if you've built brand recognition and repeat customers, you can transfer much of this business to your own store. The key is building your email list and social following before fully transitioning, and using paid advertising to replace organic Etsy traffic."
  - question: "What are the biggest mistakes sellers make when migrating to Shopify?"
    answer: "The top mistakes are: shutting down Etsy too quickly before building alternative traffic, not capturing email addresses from Etsy customers, choosing a theme that's too complex, underestimating marketing costs, not setting up proper analytics, and trying to migrate everything at once instead of starting with bestsellers."

You've built a successful Etsy shop. Sales are consistent, customers leave glowing reviews, and your brand is growing. But lately, something doesn't feel right.

Maybe it's the constant fee increases. Maybe it's watching your listings fluctuate in search results with no explanation. Maybe it's realizing that after years of work, you don't have a single customer email address.

If you're wondering whether it's time to launch your own Shopify store, you're not alone. Thousands of Etsy sellers make this transition every year—and 2026 might be your year.

This guide covers everything you need to know: the signs you've outgrown Etsy, what you gain (and lose) by moving, how to execute the migration, and how to avoid the costly mistakes that trip up most sellers.

## Signs You've Outgrown Etsy

Not every Etsy seller should migrate to Shopify. The platform works beautifully for sellers who are still building their customer base or who benefit from Etsy's marketplace traffic.

But there are clear indicators that you've reached the point where Etsy is holding you back.

### Revenue Thresholds That Signal It's Time

**$50,000+ annual revenue** is typically the inflection point where the math starts favoring your own store. At this level:

- Etsy fees become a significant expense ($7,500+ annually)
- You have enough sales volume to justify marketing investment
- Your brand has proven product-market fit
- Payment processing savings alone can offset Shopify costs

**$100,000+ annual revenue** makes migration almost a no-brainer. You're paying Etsy approximately $15,000+ in fees—money that could fund advertising, inventory, or your own salary.

| Annual Revenue | Approximate Etsy Fees | Potential Annual Savings with Shopify |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| $50,000 | $7,600 | $3,500 |
| $100,000 | $15,200 | $9,800 |
| $250,000 | $38,000 | $24,500 |
| $500,000 | $76,000 | $49,000 |

### Repeat Customer Rate Over 20%

If more than 20% of your sales come from repeat customers, you've built something valuable—a loyal customer base that buys because of *your brand*, not because they found you on Etsy.

These customers will follow you to your own store. They're not Etsy customers who happened to buy from you; they're *your* customers who happened to use Etsy.

Check your Etsy stats: **Shop Manager > Stats > Customers > Returning customers**

If this number exceeds 20%, you have a foundation to build on.

### Brand-Specific Search Traffic

Are customers searching for your shop name or product names specifically? Signs include:

- Google searches for "[Your Brand Name]"
- Social media mentions of your brand
- Customers mentioning they "found you on Instagram" or "heard about you"
- Direct messages asking if you have a website

When people search for your brand, you're losing value every time Etsy captures that traffic and takes 15%+ from the resulting sale.

### Algorithm Anxiety

Etsy's search algorithm changes regularly, and successful sellers often wake up to find their top listings buried. If you're experiencing:

- Unexplained ranking drops
- Sales volatility that doesn't match your efforts
- Constant pressure to pay for Etsy Ads just to maintain visibility
- Fear of policy changes affecting your business

...you're experiencing the fundamental problem with building on rented land.

### Policy and Fee Frustration

Etsy has raised fees multiple times in recent years. The current fee structure (2026) includes:

- **Listing fee:** $0.20 per listing
- **Transaction fee:** 6.5% of sale price (including shipping)
- **Payment processing:** 3% + $0.25 per transaction
- **Offsite Ads fee:** 12-15% if you're enrolled (mandatory for larger sellers)
- **Etsy Ads:** Additional cost if you advertise

For many sellers, total fees approach 15-20% of revenue—a significant margin impact.

## What You Gain by Moving to Shopify

The benefits of owning your store extend far beyond fee savings.

### Customer Data Ownership

This is the single most important benefit. On Etsy, you get:
- Customer shipping addresses
- Transaction records

On Shopify, you own:
- **Email addresses** (for marketing)
- **Purchase history** (for personalization)
- **Browsing behavior** (for retargeting)
- **Customer profiles** (for segmentation)
- **Phone numbers** (for SMS marketing)

That email list you build becomes an asset worth potentially 10-20x its monthly revenue in business valuation. On Etsy, you're building Etsy's asset, not yours.

### Email Marketing Capabilities

With customer emails, you can:

- Send abandoned cart recovery emails (recover 10-15% of lost sales)
- Run product launch campaigns to existing customers
- Create seasonal promotions without paying for ads
- Build automated welcome sequences
- Segment customers by purchase behavior
- Generate repeat purchases at near-zero acquisition cost

A healthy email list typically generates 20-30% of total revenue for e-commerce stores. On Etsy, this entire revenue channel doesn't exist.

### Brand Control

Your Shopify store is 100% your brand:

- Custom design that matches your aesthetic
- Your domain name (not etsy.com/shop/yourname)
- No competitor listings on your pages
- Product presentation exactly how you want it
- No Etsy branding or marketplace distractions
- Control over the entire customer experience

### No Algorithm Dependency

Your visibility is in your hands. There's no:

- Mysterious ranking drops
- Forced reliance on paid ads for visibility
- Worry about policy changes
- Competition with 5 million other sellers on the same platform

You control your traffic through your marketing efforts, and that traffic is predictable.

### Better Margins After Fees

Here's a realistic cost comparison at different revenue levels:

**At $100,000 Annual Revenue:**

| Cost Category | Etsy | Shopify Basic |
|---------------|------|---------------|
| Platform Subscription | $0 | $468/year |
| Transaction Fees | $6,500 | $0 |
| Payment Processing | $3,250 | $4,000 |
| Listing Fees | ~$500 | $0 |
| Offsite Ads (if enrolled) | $5,000+ | $0 |
| **Total** | **~$15,250** | **~$4,468** |
| **Percentage of Revenue** | **15.2%** | **4.5%** |

The savings get more dramatic at higher revenue levels. At $250,000, you're looking at saving over $20,000 annually.

### Integration Ecosystem

Shopify's app ecosystem enables capabilities impossible on Etsy:

- **Email marketing:** Klaviyo, Mailchimp, Omnisend
- **Reviews:** Judge.me, Loox, Stamped
- **Subscriptions:** Recharge, Bold Subscriptions
- **Loyalty programs:** Smile.io, Loyalty Lion
- **SMS marketing:** Postscript, Attentive
- **Inventory management:** Stocky, TradeGecko
- **Accounting:** QuickBooks, Xero integrations
- **Shipping:** ShipStation, Shippo
- **AI optimization:** Tools to improve visibility in AI shopping assistants

## What You Might Miss from Etsy

Let's be honest about the trade-offs.

### Built-In Marketplace Traffic

Etsy has 90+ million active buyers searching for products. When you list on Etsy, you're tapping into existing demand. New Etsy shops can make sales within days purely from organic marketplace traffic.

On Shopify, you start with zero traffic. Every visitor comes from:
- Your marketing efforts
- Paid advertising
- Organic search (SEO)
- Social media
- Email marketing
- Word of mouth

This is the biggest adjustment. You're trading free (but fee-heavy) traffic for traffic you must generate yourself.

### Trust and Credibility Signals

Etsy provides:
- Star Seller badges
- Review systems buyers trust
- Marketplace credibility ("I've bought from Etsy before")
- Buyer protection policies
- Payment security perception

Your new Shopify store starts without this trust. You'll need:
- Professional design
- Clear policies
- Trust badges
- Social proof (reviews, testimonials)
- Secure checkout messaging
- Time to build reputation

### Simplicity

Etsy handles many complexities:
- Payment processing (built-in)
- Sales tax collection and remittance in many states
- Basic shipping label purchasing
- Simple listing interface
- Mobile app for management

Shopify requires more technical involvement:
- Theme selection and customization
- App installation and configuration
- Payment gateway setup
- Tax configuration
- Domain management
- More shipping logistics decisions

The learning curve is real, though Shopify has made significant improvements in simplicity.

### Discovery by New Customers

On Etsy, customers browsing handmade jewelry might discover your shop accidentally. This serendipitous discovery is a genuine advantage of marketplaces.

On your own store, customers need a reason to arrive. You won't get "browsers" who stumbled upon your products—you get intentional visitors you've attracted.

## Step-by-Step Migration Process

Here's how to execute the transition systematically.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

**1. Start your Shopify free trial**

Shopify offers a 3-day free trial, then $1/month for 3 months. This gives you time to build without significant investment.

**2. Choose your plan**

- **Starter ($5/month):** For selling through social/messaging only
- **Basic ($39/month):** Full online store, best for most migrating sellers
- **Shopify ($105/month):** Lower payment processing fees, worth it above $100K revenue
- **Advanced ($399/month):** Advanced reporting, best for $500K+ revenue

Most Etsy sellers start with Basic and upgrade as revenue grows.

**3. Select and customize your theme**

Start with a free theme to keep costs low:
- **Dawn** (default, clean and fast)
- **Craft** (good for handmade products)
- **Sense** (minimal, elegant)

Avoid over-customization initially. A clean, fast-loading store beats a beautiful slow one.

**4. Set up your domain**

Options:
- Buy through Shopify ($14-18/year)
- Connect existing domain
- Keep your brand name consistent

Your domain is a long-term asset. Invest in a good one.

### Phase 2: Product Migration (Weeks 2-4)

**1. Export your Etsy listings**

Etsy allows CSV export: **Shop Manager > Settings > Options > Download Data**

**2. Start with bestsellers**

Don't migrate everything at once. Begin with your:
- Top 10 best-selling products
- Highest-margin items
- Products with best reviews
- Items that represent your brand well

**3. Improve listings during migration**

Don't just copy-paste. Enhance:
- Better photography (you own the layout now)
- Expanded descriptions
- More detailed specifications
- SEO-optimized titles and meta descriptions
- AI-optimized product information

**4. Set up collections/categories**

Organize products logically for browsing. Consider:
- Product type
- Price range
- Occasion/use case
- Collections/themes

### Phase 3: Essential Setup (Weeks 3-4)

**1. Payment processing**

Set up Shopify Payments (best rates) or your preferred gateway:
- Shopify Payments: 2.9% + $0.30 (Basic plan)
- PayPal: Additional option for customer choice
- Shop Pay: Accelerated checkout

**2. Shipping configuration**

- Set shipping rates (free shipping threshold recommended)
- Configure zones
- Connect carrier accounts for live rates
- Set up shipping label purchasing

**3. Tax settings**

- Enable automatic tax calculation
- Configure for your locations
- Consider tax remittance apps if needed

**4. Essential pages**

Create:
- About page (your story, why buy from you)
- Contact page
- Shipping policy
- Return/refund policy
- FAQ page
- Privacy policy

**5. Email capture setup**

Install email marketing app (Klaviyo, Mailchimp) and create:
- Pop-up for new visitors (10% off first order)
- Footer signup form
- Checkout opt-in

This is crucial. Start building your list immediately.

### Phase 4: Trust Building (Week 4)

**1. Import reviews**

Use apps like Loox, Judge.me, or Stamped to import your Etsy reviews (check their policies on this).

**2. Add trust signals**

- Trust badges at checkout
- Security seals
- Payment method logos
- Money-back guarantee badge

**3. Social proof**

- Link social media accounts
- Display Instagram feed
- Show press mentions if applicable
- Feature customer photos

### Phase 5: Launch Preparation (Week 5)

**1. Test everything**

- Complete a test purchase
- Check email confirmations
- Verify shipping calculations
- Test on mobile devices
- Check page load speed

**2. Set up analytics**

- Shopify Analytics (built-in)
- Google Analytics 4
- Facebook Pixel (for advertising)
- UTM tracking setup

**3. Prepare launch marketing**

- Announcement email to personal network
- Social media launch posts
- Etsy insert cards promoting your website
- Consider launch discount code

## Running Both Platforms Simultaneously

The smartest migration strategy is gradual transition, not immediate abandonment.

### The Dual-Platform Strategy

**Continue on Etsy for:**
- New customer acquisition (free traffic)
- International buyers familiar with Etsy
- Gift buyers who trust the platform
- Testing new products

**Use Shopify for:**
- Repeat customers
- Email marketing recipients
- Social media traffic
- Paid advertising campaigns
- Higher-value orders

### Cross-Promotion Tactics

**In Etsy orders, include:**
- Business card with website URL
- Insert card offering 10% off first website order
- Packaging with your branding and website

**Do NOT:**
- Mention website in Etsy listings (policy violation)
- Direct Etsy messages to your website
- Use Etsy to advertise off-platform (risk of suspension)

### Inventory Management

Use inventory sync tools to prevent overselling:
- **Sellbrite** — Multi-channel listing and inventory
- **Shopify Markets** — For managing multiple channels
- **Codisto** — Marketplace integration

Or manually manage inventory for low-volume sellers.

### Gradual Traffic Shift

Typical timeline:

| Month | Etsy % | Shopify % |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1-3 | 90% | 10% |
| 4-6 | 70% | 30% |
| 7-9 | 50% | 50% |
| 10-12 | 30% | 70% |
| 12+ | 10-20% | 80-90% |

Some sellers keep Etsy indefinitely as a customer acquisition channel, running only bestsellers there.

## Cost Comparison: Etsy vs Shopify at Scale

Let's do detailed math at different revenue levels.

### $50,000 Annual Revenue

**Etsy Costs:**
- Transaction fee (6.5%): $3,250
- Payment processing (3% + $0.25): ~$1,625
- Listing fees: ~$200
- **Total: $5,075 (10.2%)**

**Shopify Basic Costs:**
- Subscription: $468
- Payment processing (2.9% + $0.30): ~$1,650
- **Total: $2,118 (4.2%)**

**Annual Savings: $2,957**

### $100,000 Annual Revenue

**Etsy Costs:**
- Transaction fee: $6,500
- Payment processing: ~$3,250
- Listing fees: ~$400
- Offsite Ads (12% if enrolled, estimated): $5,000
- **Total: $15,150 (15.2%)**

**Shopify Basic Costs:**
- Subscription: $468
- Payment processing: ~$3,200
- Apps (estimated): $100/month = $1,200
- **Total: $4,868 (4.9%)**

**Annual Savings: $10,282**

Note: You'll likely spend some savings on marketing, but the money goes to growth rather than fees.

### $250,000 Annual Revenue

**Etsy Costs:**
- Transaction fee: $16,250
- Payment processing: ~$8,125
- Listing fees: ~$800
- Offsite Ads (mandatory at this level, 12%): $30,000
- **Total: $55,175 (22.1%)**

**Shopify Shopify Plan Costs:**
- Subscription: $1,260
- Payment processing (2.6% + $0.30): ~$7,000
- Apps: ~$2,400
- **Total: $10,660 (4.3%)**

**Annual Savings: $44,515**

At this scale, the savings are transformative. That's profit you keep or marketing budget to accelerate growth.

## Success Stories: What to Expect

### The Jewelry Seller: $80K to $350K in 18 Months

Sarah sold handmade jewelry on Etsy for 4 years, hitting $80K revenue but feeling stuck. After migrating to Shopify:

- Built email list to 8,000 subscribers in first year
- Email marketing now drives 35% of revenue
- Reduced effective fee rate from 14% to 5%
- Invested savings in Facebook and Instagram ads
- Reached $350K revenue in year two

Key insight: "The email list changed everything. On Etsy, I was constantly chasing new customers. Now I can launch a collection and make $15K in a weekend from my list alone."

### The Home Decor Brand: 6-Month Transition

Mark ran a home decor shop doing $150K on Etsy. His transition:

- Month 1-2: Set up Shopify, migrated top 20 products
- Month 3-4: Added inserts to all Etsy orders, built email list to 2,000
- Month 5-6: Launched Facebook ads, hit $12K first month
- Month 7-12: Shopify revenue exceeded Etsy
- Today: 80% Shopify, 20% Etsy, total revenue $280K

Key insight: "I should have started capturing emails years earlier. Every Etsy sale without getting an email was a missed opportunity."

### The Craft Supplies Shop: Keeping Both

Jennifer sells craft supplies, doing $200K across platforms:

- Maintains Etsy for discoverability and new customers
- Runs website for repeat buyers and wholesale
- Uses Etsy as "top of funnel" only
- Offers website exclusives to drive direct traffic
- Split: 40% Etsy, 60% Shopify

Key insight: "For my category, Etsy shoppers are actively searching. I let Etsy do the acquisition, then convert them to my site for repeat purchases."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Shutting Down Etsy Too Quickly

**The error:** Assuming Shopify will replace Etsy revenue immediately.

**The reality:** It takes 6-12 months to build reliable traffic to a new store. Keep Etsy running during transition.

**The fix:** Set a rule—don't reduce Etsy until Shopify reaches 50% of your Etsy revenue.

### Mistake 2: Not Building Email List Before Migration

**The error:** Launching Shopify without any existing audience.

**The reality:** Your first customers should come from existing relationships—Etsy buyers you've connected with elsewhere.

**The fix:** Start an Instagram or Pinterest account NOW. Build it for 3-6 months before launching. Capture emails from social followers first.

### Mistake 3: Over-Investing in Design

**The error:** Spending $5K+ on custom theme before proving sales.

**The reality:** A free theme that converts beats a beautiful theme nobody sees.

**The fix:** Start with Dawn or Craft theme. Invest in design after hitting $10K/month consistently.

### Mistake 4: Migrating All Products at Once

**The error:** Moving 200 listings to Shopify in a weekend.

**The reality:** Each listing should be improved, not just copied. Quality beats quantity.

**The fix:** Start with your top 10-20 products. Add more as you refine your process.

### Mistake 5: Underestimating Marketing Costs

**The error:** Assuming Shopify traffic is "free" like Etsy.

**The reality:** You'll spend money acquiring customers through ads, content, or time on social media.

**The fix:** Budget 20-30% of target revenue for marketing in year one. This typically decreases to 10-15% as organic traffic and email revenue grow.

### Mistake 6: Ignoring Mobile Experience

**The error:** Building and testing only on desktop.

**The reality:** 70%+ of e-commerce traffic is mobile. Your store must work perfectly on phones.

**The fix:** Test every page on multiple mobile devices. Prioritize mobile checkout experience.

### Mistake 7: Not Setting Up Analytics

**The error:** Launching without tracking.

**The reality:** You can't improve what you can't measure. Without analytics, you're flying blind.

**The fix:** Set up Google Analytics 4, Facebook Pixel, and Shopify Analytics before launch. Learn to read the data.

## Taking the Next Step

If you've recognized yourself in this guide—the growing revenue, the repeat customers, the fee frustration, the lack of customer data—2026 might be your year to build something you truly own.

The sellers who succeed don't just migrate platforms. They transform from marketplace vendors into brand owners. They build assets (email lists, customer relationships, brand recognition) that compound over time.

Etsy served its purpose. It helped you validate your products, build skills, and find initial customers. But the next chapter of your business happens when you own the stage.

**Ready to start?** [Begin your Shopify free trial](https://www.shopify.com/free-trial) and take the first step toward owning your brand.

Start with the basics. Migrate your bestsellers. Capture every email. And give yourself 12 months to build something remarkable.

Your future customers—the ones who'll find you through AI shopping assistants, search engines, social media, and word of mouth—are waiting to discover a store that's entirely yours.
