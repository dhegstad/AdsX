faqs:
  - question: "What is the difference between GEO and AISO?"
    answer: "GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) is an academically coined term focused specifically on optimizing content so that AI-generated engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini cite your brand in their responses. AISO (AI Search Optimization) is a broader, practitioner-friendly umbrella term that covers all strategies—organic and paid—to improve your brand's presence across AI-powered search platforms. In practice, both refer to the same core goal: being visible when AI answers questions in your category."
  - question: "What does LLMO stand for?"
    answer: "LLMO stands for Large Language Model Optimization. It refers to the practice of making your brand's content, data, and authority signals legible and trustworthy to large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini. The term emphasizes the underlying technology—LLMs—rather than the surface experience of AI search, and is often preferred by more technical audiences and developers working on content pipelines."
  - question: "Is AEO the same as GEO?"
    answer: "AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) and GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) overlap significantly but have different scopes. AEO is an older term that originally described optimizing for featured snippets and voice search—answer-first surfaces that predate modern AI. GEO is newer and specifically describes optimization for AI-generated answers powered by large language models. Today, AEO is increasingly used interchangeably with GEO, but GEO is more precise for the current generation of AI platforms."
  - question: "Which term should I use when talking to clients or stakeholders?"
    answer: "Use the term that resonates with your audience. AISO and 'AI Search Optimization' tend to land best with marketing generalists and business leaders because they are intuitive. GEO works well with SEO professionals who appreciate the analogy to their existing discipline. LLMO is best suited to technical audiences, developers, and engineers. All terms describe overlapping practices—the right label is the one that gets your stakeholders aligned and acting."
  - question: "Do I need separate strategies for GEO, LLMO, and AEO?"
    answer: "No. Because GEO, LLMO, AEO, and AISO all describe optimization for AI-driven discovery, the core tactics are the same: build entity clarity, produce factual and quotable content, earn third-party authority signals, implement structured data, and monitor your brand's AI representation. You may apply slightly different emphasis depending on your platform focus—for example, emphasizing real-time content freshness for Perplexity vs. deep training-data authority for ChatGPT—but you do not need a separate strategy for each term."

If you have spent any time researching how to get your brand mentioned by ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Google's AI Overviews, you have likely encountered a confusing alphabet soup: GEO, AISO, LLMO, AEO, SGE, LLM Marketing. These terms appear across blogs, conference decks, and agency pitches—often used interchangeably, sometimes defined differently, and occasionally invented to sound more proprietary than they are.

This guide cuts through the confusion. Below is a plain-English breakdown of every major AI search optimization term, where each came from, what it actually means, and when it is the right word to use.

## Why So Many Terms for the Same Thing?

The terminology explosion is a direct result of how fast AI-powered search grew. Between 2022 and 2025, ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot went from niche tools to mainstream search destinations handling billions of queries per week. Researchers, SEO practitioners, and marketing agencies all began labeling this new optimization challenge simultaneously—and they chose different names.

The result is a field where five terms can describe nearly identical practices. Understanding the origin and emphasis of each term helps you choose the right language for the right audience and understand what vendors and researchers are actually offering.

---

## GEO: Generative Engine Optimization

**Origin:** Academic research. In 2023, researchers at Princeton University, Georgia Tech, and the Allen Institute for AI published the paper *"GEO: Generative Engine Optimization,"* which formally defined the discipline and tested specific optimization tactics against measurable outcomes.

**What it means:** GEO is the practice of optimizing content, authority signals, and brand data so that AI-powered generative engines—systems that *generate* answers rather than returning a list of links—select your brand as a source when responding to user queries.

**The core insight from the Princeton research:**

| GEO Tactic | Measured Improvement |
|---|---|
| Adding statistics | +41% citation rate |
| Including expert quotations | +28% citation rate |
| Citing authoritative sources | +25% citation rate |
| Using authoritative language | +15% citation rate |
| Adding technical terminology | +12% citation rate |

The research also found that traditional SEO tactics like keyword stuffing performed *worse* than doing nothing, underscoring that generative engines require a fundamentally different approach.

**When to use the term GEO:** With SEO professionals, content strategists, and anyone familiar with the analogy to traditional search optimization. The term has strong credibility with technically literate audiences because of its academic origin.

**Platforms GEO targets:** ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and any other AI system that generates answers rather than ranking pages.

---

## AISO: AI Search Optimization

**Origin:** Practitioner coinage. AISO emerged from marketing agencies and consultants as a more intuitive label for the same practices GEO describes. It does not come from a single academic paper—it spread organically as digital marketers needed a client-friendly term.

**What it means:** AI Search Optimization is the broad discipline of improving your brand's visibility, accuracy, and sentiment across AI-powered search and discovery platforms. It encompasses both organic tactics (content quality, entity clarity, authority building) and paid tactics (sponsored placements on Perplexity and ChatGPT).

**The AISO scope:**

- Organic content optimization for AI citation
- Structured data and schema markup
- Brand entity management across the web
- Review and third-party mention building
- Sponsored AI placements
- AI brand monitoring and reputation management

**When to use the term AISO:** With marketing leaders, CMOs, and general business stakeholders. The phrase "AI Search Optimization" is immediately self-explanatory to anyone familiar with "search engine optimization." It does not require explaining what a generative engine or large language model is.

**Relationship to GEO:** AISO and GEO describe the same goal. If GEO is the academic name, AISO is the practitioner name. Most agencies use them interchangeably, or use AISO as the umbrella and GEO as the organic optimization sub-discipline.

---

## LLMO: Large Language Model Optimization

**Origin:** Developer and technical marketing communities. LLMO surfaced alongside the widespread deployment of LLM APIs and reflects a more infrastructure-level perspective on AI visibility.

**What it means:** Large Language Model Optimization focuses on making your brand's information legible, accurate, and authoritative to the LLMs that power AI search and recommendation systems. Where GEO focuses on the search experience layer, LLMO focuses on the model layer—the underlying technology that generates responses.

**What LLMO practitioners emphasize:**

- How LLMs form representations of brands during training
- The role of training data distribution in model knowledge
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and how your content enters retrieval pipelines
- Structured data formats that improve machine parsability
- Consistency and accuracy of brand facts across the entire web (since LLMs learn from the consensus of many sources)

**The technical framing:**

> LLMs don't "visit" your website the way Google's crawler does. They learn from patterns across billions of web pages and documents during training. LLMO is about making sure those patterns consistently and accurately represent your brand.

**When to use the term LLMO:** With developers, data engineers, technical SEOs, and anyone who needs to understand how AI models *work* rather than just how AI search *feels*. It is also useful when discussing RAG systems, vector databases, and AI agent architectures where the model's internal representation of your brand directly affects what it recommends.

## AEO: Answer Engine Optimization

**Origin:** SEO industry, circa 2018–2019. AEO predates the current generation of AI search. It was originally coined to describe optimization for featured snippets, knowledge panels, voice search results (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant), and other "answer-first" surfaces where users receive direct responses rather than links.

**What it means today:** AEO has evolved with the technology. In its modern usage, AEO describes optimization for any platform where users receive direct answers rather than navigating to a list of links. This now includes AI chatbots and generative search, making AEO and GEO substantially overlapping concepts.

**Historical AEO vs. Modern AEO:**

| Era | AEO Focus |
|---|---|
| 2018–2021 | Featured snippets, People Also Ask boxes, voice assistants |
| 2022–2023 | Google SGE (Search Generative Experience), Bing AI |
| 2024–2026 | ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini AI Mode, Copilot |

**When to use the term AEO:** When speaking to audiences steeped in traditional SEO who are familiar with the featured snippet era. AEO provides useful historical continuity—it signals that AI search optimization is an *evolution* of existing practices, not a complete departure from them. Some agencies prefer AEO because it does not require explaining what a generative engine is.

**Key difference from GEO:** GEO is specifically about LLM-generated responses. AEO can still refer to non-AI direct answer surfaces like traditional featured snippets. In 2026, the practical difference has narrowed considerably, but the terminology distinction still matters in technical conversations.

## SGE Optimization / AI Overviews Optimization

**Origin:** Google-specific terminology. SGE (Search Generative Experience) was Google's internal name during the beta testing of its AI-powered search feature. In 2024, Google rebranded it to "AI Overviews" for general availability.

**What it means:** Optimization specifically targeted at appearing in Google's AI-generated summaries that appear above traditional search results. This is a subset of GEO focused on a single platform.

**Why it merits its own label:**

- AI Overviews draw primarily from pages that *already rank well* in traditional Google search, unlike ChatGPT or Perplexity which can cite sources regardless of their Google rankings
- Technical requirements overlap heavily with traditional SEO (E-E-A-T signals, core web vitals)
- Google's AI Overviews have their own distinct formatting preferences and citation patterns

**When to use the term:** When discussing Google's specific product in the context of an integrated SEO and AI visibility strategy. "SGE optimization" is largely outdated and should be replaced with "AI Overviews optimization" in current materials.

---

## LLM Marketing

**Origin:** B2B marketing and demand generation communities. LLM Marketing is a practice-oriented frame that asks: how do marketers *use* LLMs in their marketing workflows, and how do they *market to* the audiences who increasingly discover through LLMs?

**What it means:** The term covers two related ideas:

1. **Using LLMs as marketing tools** — AI-generated content, campaign optimization, audience modeling, personalization
2. **Marketing through LLMs** — Ensuring your brand is positively and accurately represented when AI platforms surface your category to potential customers

The second meaning overlaps directly with GEO and AISO. The first is about operational efficiency.

**When to use the term:** In demand generation and growth marketing contexts where teams need to articulate both the operational and visibility dimensions of AI in their programs. Avoid using it as a synonym for GEO—it can cause confusion with the workflow-automation meaning.

---

## AI Visibility

**Origin:** Brand monitoring and PR communities. AI Visibility is the outcomes-focused frame: rather than naming the optimization *process*, it names the *result* that brands are trying to achieve.

**What it means:** AI Visibility refers to the degree to which a brand is present, accurate, and positively represented in AI-generated content and recommendations across platforms. High AI visibility means that when potential customers ask AI assistants about your category, your brand is mentioned prominently and described correctly.

**Key AI Visibility metrics:**

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| Share of Model (SoM) | Percentage of relevant AI responses mentioning your brand |
| Mention Rate | Frequency of brand appearance across a defined query set |
| Sentiment Score | Positive, neutral, or negative framing in AI responses |
| Citation Position | First, middle, or last in a list of recommendations |
| Accuracy Rate | Percentage of AI-generated facts about your brand that are correct |

**When to use the term:** In reporting, dashboards, and executive conversations where you need to describe the *outcome* rather than the *process*. "AI Visibility" lands well in board decks and quarterly business reviews where acronyms like GEO or LLMO require explanation.

## How All the Terms Relate to Each Other

The following map shows how each term relates in terms of scope and origin:

| Term | Origin | Scope | Best Audience |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GEO** | Academic (Princeton, 2023) | Organic optimization for AI-generated answers | SEO professionals, content strategists |
| **AISO** | Practitioner | Full-funnel AI search optimization (organic + paid) | Marketing leaders, CMOs, agencies |
| **LLMO** | Technical/developer | Optimization at the model and data layer | Developers, technical SEOs, data teams |
| **AEO** | SEO industry (2018) | Optimization for any direct-answer surface | Traditional SEO audiences |
| **SGE / AI Overviews** | Google | Google-specific AI search feature | SEO and search marketers focused on Google |
| **LLM Marketing** | Demand generation | Marketing with and through LLMs | Growth marketers, demand gen teams |
| **AI Visibility** | Brand monitoring / PR | Measured outcome of AI optimization efforts | Executives, board reporting, PR teams |

The honest summary: all of these terms describe variations of the same underlying challenge. Brands and their content need to be legible, trustworthy, and authoritative to the AI systems that are increasingly mediating how people discover products, services, and information. Whether you call it GEO, AISO, or LLMO, the work is similar.

## Which Tactics Work Regardless of the Label

Because the terminology is largely interchangeable at the practice level, the following tactics improve your standing across all AI platforms no matter which acronym your team prefers:

### 1. Entity Clarity

AI systems represent your brand as an *entity* with defined attributes: what you are, what category you belong to, who you serve, and what makes you different. Inconsistent or vague entity information reduces AI citations.

**What to do:** Write clear, quotable definitional statements about your brand on your website. Ensure your company name, description, and category are identical across your website, Wikipedia (if applicable), LinkedIn, Google Business Profile, and major review sites.

### 2. Factual Density

The Princeton GEO research found that adding concrete statistics improved AI citation rates by 41%. AI systems prefer content that includes specific numbers, named examples, and verifiable claims over content with vague or aspirational language.

**What to do:** Add specific data points to every key page. Replace phrases like "we help businesses grow" with "clients report a 34% average reduction in sales cycle time within 90 days."

### 3. Third-Party Authority

AI models learn from consensus across many sources. A brand mentioned positively in three independent, authoritative publications is significantly more likely to be recommended than a brand that only appears on its own website.

**What to do:** Prioritize earning coverage in industry publications, news outlets, analyst reports, and third-party comparison sites. A single well-placed feature in a trusted publication can shift your AI representation more than dozens of self-published blog posts.

### 4. Structured Data

Schema markup (Organization, Product, FAQ, Review) provides explicit machine-readable signals that help AI systems correctly categorize and reference your brand.

**What to do:** Implement at minimum Organization and FAQ schema across your key pages. For product-focused brands, add Product and Review schema.

### 5. Content Accessibility

AI crawlers need to be able to access your content. If your robots.txt blocks AI crawlers, or your most important content sits behind login walls or JavaScript-heavy rendering, AI systems cannot learn from it.

**What to do:** Review your robots.txt and ensure major AI crawlers (GPTBot, PerplexityBot, ClaudeBot, Googlebot) have access to your highest-value pages.

## A Note on Emerging Terms

The terminology landscape will continue to evolve. Several terms are gaining traction in 2026:

- **AI Answer Optimization (AAO)** — A newer variant of AEO being used by some agencies to distinguish LLM-generated answers from traditional featured snippets
- **Conversational Search Optimization (CSO)** — Emphasizes the dialogue-based nature of AI search interactions
- **Model Presence** — A PR-flavored term describing how completely and accurately a brand is represented in a model's knowledge
- **Agentic Visibility** — Optimization for AI agents that take actions (book appointments, make purchases) on behalf of users, where the agent must trust your brand to include it in transactions

None of these have reached the adoption level of GEO or AISO, but they signal where the field is heading: toward optimization not just for AI answers, but for AI actions.

## Key Takeaways

1. **GEO, AISO, LLMO, and AEO all describe overlapping practices.** The differences are of emphasis and origin, not of substance.

2. **Choose your term based on your audience.** AISO for marketing leaders, GEO for SEO professionals, LLMO for technical teams, AEO for traditional search audiences.

3. **The underlying tactics are the same.** Entity clarity, factual density, third-party authority, structured data, and content accessibility improve your standing across all AI platforms regardless of which acronym you use.

4. **AI Visibility is the outcome.** All optimization efforts should ultimately be measured by whether your brand is present, accurate, and positively framed in AI-generated responses.

5. **The terminology will keep evolving.** Stay focused on the practices rather than the labels, and you will not get left behind as new terms emerge.
