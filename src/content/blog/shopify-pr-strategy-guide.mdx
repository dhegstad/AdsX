faqs:
  - question: "Why is PR important for Shopify stores and e-commerce brands?"
    answer: "PR builds credibility and brand authority in ways that paid advertising cannot. Media coverage from reputable publications establishes your store as a legitimate, newsworthy brand, influences customer trust, drives organic traffic, and creates lasting SEO value. For e-commerce brands, third-party validation through PR is especially powerful because it converts skeptical shoppers into confident customers."
  - question: "How long does it take to get media coverage for a Shopify store?"
    answer: "Timeline varies based on news angle and your media relationships. Initial coverage from smaller or niche publications can happen within 2-4 weeks. Major publications typically require 4-8 weeks of relationship building and pitch refinement. However, with strong relationships and compelling stories, urgent coverage can happen in days. Consistency matters—develop relationships over months to unlock easier placements."
  - question: "What makes a press release effective for e-commerce stores?"
    answer: "Effective press releases for e-commerce brands include a clear news hook (new product, milestone, funding, partnership), specific customer impact metrics, relevant quotes from leadership, and newsworthy details that matter to journalists. Avoid generic announcements; focus on what's genuinely novel or interesting to the target publication's audience. The best releases answer 'why this matters now' within the first paragraph."
  - question: "Can PR help with SEO for Shopify stores?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Quality media coverage with backlinks to your Shopify store provides high-authority signals to search engines. Links from respected publications improve domain authority, help your store rank for competitive keywords, and drive referral traffic that reduces bounce rates. Additionally, press coverage creates opportunities for branded keywords and long-tail visibility. The SEO benefits often exceed immediate sales impact."
  - question: "What PR tools and services work best for Shopify merchants?"
    answer: "Top options include Cision and PR Newswire for distribution, Help A Reporter Out (HARO) for earned media opportunities, Muck Rack for media database research, and specialized services like Shopify's own PR resources. Many growing stores use fractional PR agencies or consultants who understand e-commerce. Others handle PR in-house using free tools like Twitter, LinkedIn for relationship building, and email outreach combined with platforms like Press Forward for tracking coverage."

For Shopify store owners, building a successful e-commerce business means more than great products and marketing campaigns—it means establishing your brand as an authority worthy of media attention. Public relations offers a unique advantage that traditional marketing cannot replicate: third-party credibility. When a respected publication features your story, potential customers see validation beyond your own promotional voice.

This comprehensive guide walks you through developing and executing a PR strategy specifically designed for Shopify stores, from crafting press releases that journalists actually read to building relationships with media professionals who can amplify your brand.

## Why PR Matters for E-Commerce Brands

Before diving into tactics, let's establish why PR deserves a central place in your e-commerce marketing strategy.

### The Trust Problem E-Commerce Brands Face

Online shopping still carries inherent skepticism. Even the best product photos and customer reviews can't fully overcome the doubt potential customers feel before making a purchase. Media coverage solves this problem differently than any other marketing channel.

**Why media coverage works:**

- **Third-party validation**: Journalists are (theoretically) unbiased. When they write about your brand, readers believe it more than if you told the same story yourself
- **Selective credibility**: A mention in The Wall Street Journal carries different weight than a mention in a niche blog—and both are more credible than your own marketing copy
- **Extended reach**: Coverage in one publication gets shared across social media, amplifying your message far beyond the initial article
- **Searchability**: Archived articles continue driving traffic and SEO value for years after publication

### PR vs. Paid Marketing for Shopify Stores

| Aspect | Paid Ads | PR Coverage |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Cost per impression | Lower | Higher upfront, but value compounds |
| Credibility impact | Limited | Very high |
| SEO benefit | Minimal | Substantial |
| Longevity | Stops when budget ends | Builds authority over time |
| Customer conversion | Higher immediate | Higher long-term trust |
| Scalability | Easy to increase spend | Requires relationship development |

The best e-commerce brands use PR and paid marketing together: PR builds the credibility foundation, while paid ads leverage that authority to accelerate sales.

### Specific Benefits for Shopify Merchants

**Customer Acquisition**: Media coverage reaches potential customers who don't know your brand exists, bringing them to your store already impressed.

**Product Launches**: Launching a new product line? A press placement makes the difference between quiet launch and buzz-generating news.

**Milestone Celebrations**: Reached $1M in revenue? Celebrating 5 years in business? These milestones become media angles when positioned correctly.

**Crisis Prevention**: Strong PR relationships mean journalists know your story, making them more likely to ask for context during controversies rather than running negative stories unchecked.

## Understanding Your Shopify Store's PR Assets

Every business has PR-worthy angles. Your job is identifying and developing them.

### Types of Stories That Get Media Coverage

**Product Stories**
- Innovative products solving real problems
- Unique design or manufacturing approach
- Sustainable or ethical sourcing
- Product collaborations with other brands

**Founder Stories**
- Personal journey to launching the store
- Overcoming challenges or obstacles
- Career pivots or unconventional paths
- Unique perspective or vision

**Business Milestones**
- Revenue/sales achievements
- Customer count milestones
- Geographic expansion
- Awards or recognition

**Market Insights**
- Trends you've noticed in your industry
- Data from your customer base
- Consumer behavior insights
- Predictions about industry direction

**Partnerships and Collaborations**
- New supplier relationships
- Brand partnerships
- Influencer collaborations
- Strategic alliances

**Community and Social Impact**
- Charitable giving or initiatives
- Environmental commitments
- Diversity and inclusion efforts
- Community engagement

### Identifying Your Strongest Angles

For your Shopify store, look for angles that combine:

1. **Novelty**: What's genuinely new about what you're doing?
2. **Relevance**: Why does this matter to the journalist's audience right now?
3. **Data**: Can you support your story with numbers, research, or specific examples?
4. **Personality**: Does your founder or team have an interesting background or perspective?

## Writing Press Releases That Actually Get Coverage

Most press releases get ignored. The ones that generate coverage follow a specific formula.

### The Press Release Structure

**Headline** (60 characters or fewer)
- Should summarize your news in journalistic language, not marketing language
- Avoid exclamation marks, jargon, or hype
- Examples:
  - "Sustainable Fashion Brand Reduces Packaging Waste by 75%"
  - "Online Retailer Reaches $5M Revenue Milestone Using Shopify"

**Dateline**
- City name and date of release
- Example: "SAN FRANCISCO, February 21, 2026"

**Lead Paragraph**
- Answer "who," "what," "where," "when," and "why" in the first sentence
- Include specific, newsworthy information
- Keep to 2-3 sentences maximum

Example lead:
*"Online jewelry retailer GemLight announced today that it has surpassed $2M in annual revenue, driven by a new sustainable sourcing initiative that resonates with eco-conscious consumers. The milestone marks the company's fastest growth year since launching on Shopify in 2023."*

**Supporting Paragraphs**
- Provide context and details
- Include relevant statistics or data
- Explain the significance of the news
- Describe next steps or broader vision

**Quote Sections**
- Include 1-2 quotes from leadership
- Quotes should sound natural, not marketing-speak
- Use quotes to add personality or perspective

Example quote:
*"When we started this business, we wanted to prove you could build a profitable e-commerce brand without compromising on sustainability. Reaching $2M in revenue shows our customers share that values. We're not an afterthought eco-brand—we're a business that happens to care deeply about the planet."*

**Boilerplate**
- 2-3 sentence description of your company
- Include website, key information
- Keep it factual and unchanging across releases

**Media Contact Information**
- Name, email, phone number
- Someone who will actually respond to inquiries

### Common Press Release Mistakes to Avoid

**Too Much Marketing Language**
- Avoid: "Revolutionary, game-changing, industry-first"
- Use: Specific facts and data instead
- Journalists look for news, not hype

**Burying the Lead**
- Put the most important information first
- Don't bury news in the third paragraph

**Vague or Generic Stories**
- "We're excited to announce growth" = Not newsworthy
- "We've become the leading sustainable retailer in the luxury segment" = Newsworthy with specificity

**Poor Grammar or Formatting**
- Proofread multiple times
- Use proper formatting with clear paragraph breaks
- Journalists judge your professionalism by your press release quality

**Wrong Distribution**
- Don't send the same release to every journalist
- Research which journalists cover your industry and tailor accordingly

## Building Media Relationships: The Foundation of PR

Long-term PR success comes from relationships, not one-off press releases.

### Identifying Journalists Who Cover Your Space

Start by mapping journalists in your industry and vertical.

**Research Sources:**
- **Industry Publications**: Find top journalists at publications your customers read
- **Twitter/LinkedIn**: Follow journalists covering your industry; understand their beats and interests
- **Google News**: Search relevant keywords; note which publications and journalists frequently cover your space
- **Press Coverage Archives**: Research which journalists have covered your competitors and similar stories
- **Database Services**: Tools like Muck Rack, Cision, or Help A Reporter Out (HARO) compile journalist directories

**Create a Media List:**
Build a spreadsheet with:
- Journalist name and publication
- Email address (verify it's current)
- Beat/focus areas
- Recent stories they've covered
- Twitter/LinkedIn handle
- Notes on their angle or interests

### Warm Outreach Before You Pitch

Don't start with a sales pitch. Start with genuine relationship building.

**Effective Relationship Building Tactics:**

1. **Read and Engage With Their Work**
   - Read recent articles by journalists on your list
   - Share relevant pieces on social media with thoughtful commentary
   - Reference their previous coverage when you do reach out

2. **Provide Helpful Information**
   - Share data or insights relevant to their recent story
   - Tag them when you publish content related to their beat
   - Offer to be a source for future stories on your expertise area

3. **Attend Industry Events**
   - Conferences where journalists gather
   - Panel discussions or speaking events
   - These chance meetings build real relationships faster than email

4. **Comment on Their Tweets/LinkedIn Posts**
   - Meaningful engagement, not generic "great post"
   - Build familiarity over time

5. **Help Their Reporting**
   - Respond quickly to HARO inquiries in their areas
   - Provide expert commentary and data when they request it
   - You're not asking for coverage; you're making their job easier

### The Right Way to Pitch Your Story

Once you've built some relationship rapport, pitches convert better.

**The Pitch Email Formula:**

*Subject line*: Relevant, specific, not "Press Release" or "Exciting News"
- Good: "E-commerce sustainability data for your coverage of green business"
- Bad: "Great press release opportunity"

*Opening*: Reference their recent work or something you know about their coverage area
- "I read your recent piece on sustainable fashion retailers and thought this data might be helpful..."

*The ask*: One to two sentences about your news
- Specific facts, not hype
- One clear angle relevant to their beat

*Why it matters to their audience*: Explain why their readers should care
- Connect to trends they've been covering
- Provide data or insights useful to their readers
- Show understanding of their publication

*Offer*: What you can provide
- Exclusive data or information?
- Expert interview?
- Founder availability?
- Specific story angle for their publication?

*Closing*: Professional, with clear contact information

**Example Pitch:**

*Subject: Shopify store sustainability data for your eco-business coverage*

*Hi Sarah,*

*I read your piece last month on the rise of eco-conscious e-commerce brands, and I thought you'd be interested in data we've gathered from our customer base. Our Shopify store, GemLight, surveyed 2,000+ online shoppers and found that 67% would pay 10-20% more for sustainably sourced products—a significant uptick from similar surveys just two years ago.*

*This data might be useful context for your ongoing coverage of green business. We're happy to share the full research or offer our founder for an interview to discuss these trends. We've also documented our transition to sustainable sourcing, which might interest your readers.*

*Are you interested in exploring this angle?*

*Best,*
[Your name]

### Following Up Without Being Annoying

Journalists get hundreds of pitches. Appropriate follow-up is necessary but must be respectful.

- **Wait 5-7 days** before a gentle follow-up
- **Don't send repeat pitches**—if they didn't respond, your angle isn't working for them
- **Try a different journalist at their publication** if appropriate
- **Move on after 2 follow-ups**—they're not interested

## Writing Effective Press Releases for Shopify

Now let's apply PR fundamentals specifically to Shopify store announcements.

### Shopify-Specific Story Angles

**You've Built Something Remarkable Using Shopify**
- Your success proves the platform's value
- Publications covering e-commerce and Shopify itself may be interested
- Position as a success story example

Example: "How a Solo Founder Built a $3M/Year Business on Shopify"

**You've Solved a Specific Shopify Problem**
- Developed a unique solution using Shopify apps
- Created a process or system other merchants need
- Offer insight that helps other Shopify sellers

Example: "New App Helps Shopify Stores Reduce Cart Abandonment by 40%"

**You're Launching Something Bold**
- New product line
- Expansion to new market
- Major partnership with supplier or brand
- Pivot toward underserved customer segment

Example: "Sustainable Fashion Brand Announces Carbon-Neutral Shipping"

**Milestone Achievements**
- Revenue milestones
- Customer count achievements
- Awards or recognition
- Anniversary celebrations with growth data

Example: "Indie E-Commerce Brand Celebrates 10 Years on Shopify with Record Revenue"

### Crafting Your Shopify Store's Press Release

**Step 1: Identify Your News Hook**

Before writing, answer:
- What's the actual news?
- Why is it newsworthy?
- Why does it matter to the publication's audience?
- What new information are you sharing?

**Step 2: Write With Journalists in Mind**

Remember: You're writing for journalists to read to their readers, not writing marketing copy.

- Use clear, direct language
- Lead with specific facts and numbers
- Explain why this matters (the "so what?")
- Include data to support claims

**Step 3: Include Shopify Naturally**

Mention your Shopify store when relevant, but don't overdo it.

Good: "...grew its Shopify store to $2M in annual revenue..."
Bad: "We're so grateful to Shopify for making this possible! Shopify is the best platform! We chose Shopify because..."

### Example Press Releases for Shopify Stores

**Example 1: Product Launch**

*"Eco-Friendly Apparel Brand Launches Line of Biodegradable Packaging"*

*SAN FRANCISCO, February 21, 2026—ThreadEarth, an online apparel retailer on Shopify, announced today the launch of fully biodegradable packaging for all orders, becoming one of the first in its segment to achieve full compostability certification.*

*The initiative eliminates approximately 5 tons of plastic from the company's annual supply chain, addressing the growing demand from environmentally conscious consumers. According to recent data, 72% of ThreadEarth's customers actively prefer brands with sustainable practices.*

*"When we talk to customers, the packaging material is mentioned as often as the product itself," said founder Maya Patel. "By moving to biodegradable packaging, we're proving that sustainability doesn't require compromise on quality or cost."*

*The transition involved evaluating 15+ vendors and implementing new supplier relationships. Despite higher material costs, ThreadEarth is absorbing the difference rather than passing costs to customers.*

*The packaging change is effective immediately for all new orders placed through ThreadEarth's Shopify store.*

---

**Example 2: Milestone**

*"Indie Fashion Retailer Reaches $5M Revenue Milestone with Direct-to-Consumer Model"*

*LOS ANGELES, February 21, 2026—Indie Fashion Collective, a women's apparel brand built on Shopify, announced it has surpassed $5M in annual revenue after just four years in business.*

*The achievement is notable because the brand reached this milestone through direct-to-consumer sales exclusively, without wholesale partnerships or traditional retail locations. Growth accelerated 150% year-over-year, driven primarily by repeat customers and word-of-mouth referrals.*

*Co-founder Jason Chen attributes the success to a specific strategy: "We invested heavily in customer retention and community rather than customer acquisition. We treat our customers like friends, not metrics. That approach builds a business that lasts."*

*The brand plans to use revenue growth to invest in product design, expand its team, and fund a nascent sustainability initiative.*

## Building and Maintaining Media Relationships

Relationships are your most valuable PR asset, but they require consistent nurturing.

### Staying Top of Mind With Journalists

**Monthly Touches:**
- Share relevant content or data from your business
- Recommend resources or stories of interest
- Congratulate them on recent coverage (genuine, not excessive)
- Provide expert commentary when asked

**Quarterly Deeper Engagement:**
- Schedule a brief call to catch up
- Send a more substantial pitch or insight
- Offer to be a source for ongoing coverage
- Invite to events relevant to their beat

**Annual Relationship Investment:**
- Offer exclusive data or research
- Invite to company events or product launches
- Provide early access to major announcements
- Consider small gifts (books, company merch) if appropriate to your relationship

### Working With PR Agencies for Shopify Stores

If you decide PR isn't a DIY effort, agencies can help. However, not all agencies understand e-commerce and Shopify specifically.

**What to Look For:**

- **E-commerce experience**: They should understand Shopify, digital retail, and online business models
- **Relevant media relationships**: Do they have connections at publications your customers read?
- **Realistic expectations**: They should explain realistic timelines and outcomes
- **Data-driven approach**: Do they measure results and adjust strategy?
- **Transparent pricing**: Avoid retainers without clear deliverables

**When PR Agencies Make Sense:**

- You're launching a significant product and need immediate media attention
- You lack time to build and maintain relationships yourself
- You need crisis communications expertise
- You're targeting major national publications

**Avoiding Common Agency Mistakes:**

- Don't let them push generic press releases without relationship building
- Insist they understand your specific target market
- Request specific publication targets, not "we'll pitch relevant publications"
- Ensure they measure results beyond "press mentions"

## Leveraging Media Coverage for SEO Benefits

The best PR strategy combines immediate brand building with long-term SEO value.

### How Media Coverage Impacts SEO

**Direct SEO Benefits:**

1. **Backlinks from Authority Domains**
   - Links from major publications pass "link juice" to your site
   - High-authority domains have greater impact than low-authority links
   - These links signal to Google that your site is credible and authoritative

2. **Domain Authority Growth**
   - Media coverage increases overall domain authority
   - Helps your site rank better for competitive keywords
   - Provides sustained ranking benefits long after coverage is published

3. **Branded Search Volume**
   - Media coverage increases searches for your brand
   - Demonstrates to Google your brand is noteworthy
   - Creates long-tail keyword opportunities around brand + product/service

4. **Referral Traffic and Signals**
   - Direct traffic from media sources signals value to search algorithms
   - Lower bounce rates (readers from trusted publications convert better)
   - Longer time on site improves ranking signals

### Maximizing SEO Value From Coverage

**Optimize Your Shopify Store for Inbound Links:**

When journalists link to you, make sure they land on relevant pages:

- **Relevant landing pages**: Provide journalists with specific URLs, not just your homepage
- **Keyword optimization**: Land pages should be optimized for keywords related to the coverage
- **Clear calls to action**: Convert incoming journalist readers into customers or email subscribers

**Capture Coverage in Your Content Strategy:**

1. **Reference Media Mentions**: Link to coverage from relevant blog posts and landing pages
2. **Update About/Credibility Pages**: Add media logos and coverage highlights
3. **Create Coverage Hub**: Compile all media mentions in one location for easy reference
4. **Leverage in Content**: Reference data points or insights from coverage in future content

**Build Sustainable Link Velocity:**

Rather than one large PR push, maintain consistent coverage:

- Steady coverage over 12 months > one viral moment
- Monthly or quarterly media placements build sustained authority
- Consistent coverage signals to Google you're a legitimate, growing brand

### Example: PR-to-SEO Value Chain

*Raw Coverage → Backlinks → Domain Authority → Better Rankings → Organic Traffic → Customer Conversions*

When your sustainable fashion brand gets featured in Vogue's e-commerce column with a backlink, you receive:
1. Immediate traffic from Vogue readers
2. High-authority backlink improving your domain authority
3. Long-term ranking improvements for fashion-related keywords
4. Organic traffic growth 3-6 months after coverage
5. Each new customer has lower acquisition cost than paid ads

## PR Tools and Services for Shopify Merchants

You don't need expensive tools to run an effective PR campaign, but certain platforms help.

### Essential PR Tools

**Press Release Distribution**
- **PR Newswire**: Industry-standard distribution to major publications
- **eReleasesonline**: More affordable alternative with decent reach
- **Shopify's own resources**: Check Shopify's partnership programs for e-commerce-specific distribution

**Media Database and Research**
- **Muck Rack**: Find journalists covering your space, track coverage
- **Help A Reporter Out (HARO)**: Free service matching experts with journalist requests
- **Cision**: Comprehensive media database (enterprise option)
- **Twitter/LinkedIn**: Free but effective for finding journalists and following coverage

**Coverage Monitoring**
- **Google Alerts**: Free monitoring for brand mentions and keywords
- **Mention.com**: Monitors web, social, and print mentions
- **Brand24**: Comprehensive social listening with sentiment analysis

**Email and Outreach**
- **Hunter.io**: Verify and find journalist email addresses
- **RocketReach**: Similar to Hunter for finding contact information
- **Gmail/Outlook**: Honest truth? Many successful PR campaigns run entirely on email

### Shopify-Specific Resources

**Shopify Affiliate Program**: Consider enrolling in [Shopify's affiliate program](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624) if you recommend the platform in your coverage or blog content. Many successful Shopify stores discuss the platform in media coverage and can generate additional revenue through affiliate commissions.

**Shopify Blog and Newsroom**: Monitor Shopify's own newsroom and blog to:
- Understand what stories Shopify is promoting
- Identify journalists frequently writing about Shopify
- Find angles connecting your success to Shopify's story

**Partner Network**: Shopify maintains relationships with top media outlets. If you're a successful partner, explore whether Shopify can make introductions.

## Creating Your Shopify Store's PR Strategy

Let's tie everything together into an actionable strategy.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)

**Objective**: Prepare for your first media outreach

**Actions:**
- Audit your business for PR-worthy angles (product, founder story, milestone, data)
- Research 15-20 journalists covering your industry and vertical
- Create a media contact spreadsheet
- Draft 2-3 potential press releases
- Set up monitoring (Google Alerts, brand mentions)

**Tools Needed:**
- Spreadsheet software (Google Sheets, Excel)

- Email

**Success Metric**: You have a clear media list and 1-2 pitchable stories ready

### Phase 2: Relationship Building (Months 2-4)

- Share valuable insights and data relevant to their beats
- Attend industry events where journalists will be present
- Read recent coverage and understand current conversations

**Tools Needed:**
- Twitter, LinkedIn, HARO (free)
- Calendar for tracking engagement

**Success Metric**: 3-5 journalists recognize you, have engaged with your content

### Phase 3: First Outreach (Months 4-6)

**Objective**: Secure your first 2-3 media placements

**Actions:**
- Send personalized pitches to journalists you've built relationships with
- Focus on smaller publications, niche verticals, and podcasts (easier entry points)
- Follow up respectfully after 5-7 days
- Track which angles resonate and which don't
- Adjust pitches based on feedback

**Tools Needed:**
- Email, personalized pitches

**Success Metric**: 1-2 media placements in industry-relevant publications

### Phase 4: Momentum Building (Months 6-12)

**Objective**: Increase coverage frequency and publication tier

**Actions:**

- Continue relationship nurturing with journalists who covered you

**Success Metric**: Monthly media placement in relevant publications, growing domain authority

## Common PR Mistakes Shopify Stores Make

Learn from others' mistakes to accelerate your success.

### Mistake 1: Waiting Until You Have Big News

**The Problem**: Waiting for a massive milestone to start PR means you miss months of relationship building.

**The Solution**: Start with smaller angles. A new product line, unique customer story, or industry insight is enough to begin journalist outreach. Build relationships now; bigger news will come.

### Mistake 2: Pitching Everyone Equally

**The Problem**: Sending generic pitches to every journalist on your list wastes time and doesn't work.

**The Solution**: Hyper-personalize pitches. Reference their recent coverage. Explain specifically why this news matters to their readers. Quality relationships matter more than volume.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Smaller Publications

**The Problem**: Only targeting national publications means impossible odds and no placements.

**The Solution**: Smaller publications are easier to get into and still provide valuable authority. Start with niche publications, trade journals, and industry blogs. Build up to larger outlets.

### Mistake 4: One-Off Press Blasts

**The Problem**: Sending a press release to everyone and expecting coverage doesn't work.

**The Solution**: PR is a long-term relationship game. Plan for consistent, monthly pitches. Build a portfolio of coverage. This creates momentum and credibility.

### Mistake 5: Not Leveraging Coverage After Publication

**The Problem**: An article runs and you move on, missing SEO and marketing opportunities.

**The Solution**: Repurpose coverage. Link to articles from your website. Add coverage to your credibility page. Share across social media. Update backlink profiles. Extract data for future content. Make coverage work for you long-term.

## Measuring Your PR Success

PR feels nebulous. Make it measurable.

### Key PR Metrics to Track

**Coverage Metrics:**
- Number of placements monthly
- Quality/tier of publications (niche vs. national)
- Estimated media value (what you'd pay for equivalent advertising)
- Share of voice vs. competitors

**Traffic Metrics:**
- Referral traffic from media coverage
- Conversion rate from referred traffic
- Average session duration for journalist referrals
- Pages visited per session

**SEO Metrics:**
- Domain authority (check monthly via Moz or Ahrefs)
- Ranking improvements for target keywords
- Organic traffic growth month-over-month
- New keywords you're ranking for

**Brand Metrics:**
- Brand search volume (increasing = PR working)
- Brand mentions across web and social
- Social media growth correlated with coverage
- Email signups attributed to coverage

**Sales Metrics:**
- Revenue attributed to media coverage (track via UTM parameters)
- Customer acquisition cost for coverage-sourced customers
- Customer lifetime value for referred customers
- Repeat purchase rate from coverage referrals

### Monthly PR Dashboard

Create a simple spreadsheet tracking:

| Metric | This Month | Last Month | YTD Trend |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Media placements | 2 | 1 | 15 |
| Unique publications | 2 | 1 | 12 |
| Referral traffic | 1,200 | 450 | 8,900 |
| Domain authority | 22 | 21 | 18 → 22 |
| Revenue attributed | $8,400 | $2,100 | $38,000 |

This makes your PR work tangible and defensible to leadership.
