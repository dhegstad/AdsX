## What is Google Gemini?

Google Gemini is Google's most capable AI model, powering:

- **Gemini App** — Standalone AI assistant at gemini.google.com
- **AI Mode in Search** — AI-generated answers integrated into Google Search
- **AI Overviews** — Summarized answers at the top of search results
- **Gemini in Workspace** — AI features in Gmail, Docs, and other Google products

For advertisers, the key surfaces are **AI Mode** and **AI Overviews** in Search, where your brand can appear alongside AI-generated recommendations.

## How Gemini Changes Search Advertising

### The Old Model: Keywords and Links

Traditional Google Ads worked like this:
1. User searches for keywords
2. Ads appear above organic results
3. User clicks through to your website

### The New Model: AI Recommendations

With Gemini, the experience shifts:
1. User asks a question
2. Gemini synthesizes an answer with product/brand recommendations
3. Sponsored placements appear within the AI response
4. User may purchase directly (via [UCP](/blog/universal-commerce-protocol-guide)) or click through

> "AI Mode isn't replacing Search—it's augmenting it. But the brands that appear in AI responses will capture disproportionate attention."

## Advertising Options on Google Gemini

Your existing Search campaigns can appear in AI Mode results. Google has extended ad placements to include:
