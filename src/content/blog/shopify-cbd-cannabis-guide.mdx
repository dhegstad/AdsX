faqs:
  - question: "Does Shopify allow CBD sales?"
    answer: "Yes, Shopify allows the sale of hemp-derived CBD products in the United States, provided they comply with federal and state regulations. Products must contain less than 0.3% THC by dry weight, be derived from hemp (not marijuana), and comply with the 2018 Farm Bill. You must use a Shopify-approved high-risk payment processor, implement age verification, and ensure proper product labeling. Shopify does not currently allow the sale of marijuana or THC products above the 0.3% threshold."
  - question: "What payment processors work for CBD on Shopify?"
    answer: "Shopify Payments does not support CBD sales, so you need a specialized high-risk payment processor. Approved options include Square (for topicals only), PayKickstart, DigiPay, Bankful, and Pinwheel. These processors specialize in high-risk industries and are pre-integrated with Shopify. Expect higher processing fees (typically 4-6% plus transaction fees) and stricter underwriting requirements including business documentation and compliance verification."
  - question: "Do I need age verification to sell CBD online?"
    answer: "While federal law doesn't require age verification for hemp CBD, many states require customers to be 18 or 21 to purchase CBD products. Most payment processors and Shopify's acceptable use policy require age verification as a best practice. Implementing age verification protects your business legally, builds customer trust, and is often required to maintain your merchant account. Apps like AgeChecker.Net and Ageverify integrate with Shopify for compliance."
  - question: "What CBD products can I sell on Shopify?"
    answer: "You can sell hemp-derived CBD products that comply with the 2018 Farm Bill, including CBD oils and tinctures, topicals (creams, balms, lotions), capsules and softgels, edibles and gummies, pet CBD products, and CBD isolate. All products must contain less than 0.3% THC and cannot make unapproved health claims. You cannot sell marijuana, delta-9 THC products above 0.3%, or synthetic cannabinoids. Some states have additional restrictions on ingestible CBD products."
  - question: "How do I ship CBD products legally?"
    answer: "CBD products can be shipped via USPS, UPS, and FedEx when they comply with the 2018 Farm Bill (hemp-derived, under 0.3% THC). Include Certificates of Analysis (COAs) with shipments as proof of compliance. Clearly label packages with product contents and THC levels. Avoid shipping to states with CBD restrictions, and consider requiring signature confirmation for high-value orders. Some carriers may require documentation proving your products' compliance before establishing shipping accounts."

The CBD industry has exploded into a multi-billion dollar market, with hemp-derived products now legally available across most of the United States. If you're looking to capitalize on this growing market, [Shopify](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624) offers a viable path to selling CBD products online legally and profitably.

However, selling CBD isn't as simple as listing products and accepting payments. The regulatory landscape is complex, payment processing requires specialized solutions, and compliance mistakes can shut down your business overnight. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know to build, launch, and scale a compliant CBD e-commerce business on Shopify.

## Understanding the Legal Landscape for CBD Sales

Before building your store, you need a solid understanding of the laws governing CBD sales. The regulatory framework involves federal, state, and local requirements that all must be satisfied.

### The 2018 Farm Bill: Foundation for Legal CBD

The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, commonly known as the Farm Bill, legalized hemp cultivation and removed hemp from the Controlled Substances Act. This legislation created the legal foundation for CBD commerce in the United States.

**Key provisions of the 2018 Farm Bill:**

- Defined legal hemp as cannabis containing less than 0.3% delta-9 THC by dry weight
- Removed hemp and hemp-derived compounds from Schedule I controlled substances
- Gave states authority to regulate hemp production
- Allowed interstate commerce of hemp products
- Maintained FDA authority over CBD in food, beverages, and dietary supplements

**What this means for sellers:**

Products derived from compliant hemp with less than 0.3% THC are federally legal to sell. However, the FDA has not approved CBD as a food additive or dietary supplement, creating regulatory gray areas that sellers must navigate carefully.

### FDA Regulations and Restrictions

While the Farm Bill legalized hemp, the FDA retained authority over how CBD products can be marketed and sold.

**Current FDA position on CBD:**

| Product Category | FDA Status | Selling Implications |
|------------------|------------|---------------------|
| CBD topicals | Generally permitted | Lowest regulatory risk |
| CBD supplements | Not approved | Cannot make drug claims |
| CBD food/beverages | Not approved | Some states prohibit |
| CBD pet products | Not approved | Growing market, regulatory uncertainty |
| CBD cosmetics | Permitted with restrictions | Must follow cosmetic regulations |

**Health claims to avoid:**

The FDA has issued warning letters to companies making unauthorized health claims about CBD. Avoid claims that CBD:

- Treats, cures, or prevents any disease
- Reduces anxiety or depression
- Relieves chronic pain
- Treats cancer or other serious conditions
- Is FDA-approved for any medical use

**Acceptable marketing language:**

- "May support overall wellness"
- "Promotes relaxation"
- "Supports a healthy sleep cycle"
- "For daily wellness routines"

These softer claims avoid triggering FDA enforcement while still communicating product benefits.

### State-by-State CBD Regulations

While CBD is federally legal, states have varying regulations that affect where and how you can sell.

**States with favorable CBD regulations:**

Most states allow hemp CBD sales with minimal restrictions. These include:

- California
- Colorado
- Florida
- Texas
- Oregon
- Michigan
- Pennsylvania
- And most others

**States with restrictions:**

Some states have stricter requirements or prohibitions:

- **Idaho**: Only allows CBD with 0.0% THC
- **South Dakota**: Requires products to be FDA-approved
- **Nebraska**: Has licensing requirements
- **Mississippi**: Restrictions on certain product types

**Best practice:**

Research regulations in every state where you plan to sell. Consider excluding problematic states from your shipping zones rather than risking compliance issues.

## Shopify's CBD Policy and Requirements

Shopify permits CBD sales under specific conditions. Understanding and following these requirements is essential for maintaining your store.

### Shopify's Acceptable Use Policy for CBD

Shopify allows the sale of hemp-derived CBD products that comply with all applicable laws. Key requirements include:

**Product requirements:**

- Legal in the merchant's jurisdiction
- Legal in states where shipped

**Prohibited products:**

- Marijuana or marijuana-derived products
- Products containing more than 0.3% THC
- Synthetic cannabinoids
- Products making drug claims
- CBD for pets in some cases (policy varies)

**Merchant requirements:**

### Documentation You Need

Before launching your CBD store, gather the following documentation:

**Product documentation:**

- Certificates of Analysis (COAs) for all products

### Getting Approved for CBD Sales

Setting up a CBD store on Shopify involves these steps:

1. **Create your Shopify store** as normal
2. **Apply for a high-risk payment processor** (covered below)
3. **Prepare compliance documentation** for processor review
4. **Implement age verification** before launch
5. **Ensure product pages meet compliance** requirements
6. **Launch only after payment processor approval**

The payment processor approval process typically takes 1-3 weeks and requires substantial documentation.

## Payment Processing for CBD E-commerce

The biggest challenge for CBD merchants is payment processing. Standard processors like Shopify Payments, Stripe, and PayPal do not support CBD sales.

### Why CBD Requires Specialized Payment Processing

CBD is classified as a "high-risk" industry by payment processors for several reasons:

- Regulatory uncertainty and evolving laws
- Higher chargeback rates in the industry
- Potential for reputational concerns
- Banking relationship complications
- Legal liability considerations

This classification means you'll pay higher processing fees and face stricter requirements than standard merchants.

### Approved Payment Processors for Shopify CBD

Several payment processors specialize in CBD and integrate with Shopify:

**Square (Limited CBD)**

- Supports CBD topicals only
- Competitive rates for topical sellers
- Easy Shopify integration
- Not suitable for ingestibles

Update these requirements as laws change. Several states have increased age requirements in recent years.

1. Go to Settings > Shipping and delivery
