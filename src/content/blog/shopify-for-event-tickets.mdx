  - question: "Can you sell event tickets directly on Shopify?"
    answer: "Yes, you can sell event tickets on Shopify using specialized ticketing apps or by configuring products with variant options for different dates and session times. The most effective approach combines Shopify's product and inventory management with a dedicated ticketing app like Ticketfy, Eventix, or Ticket Tailor, which handle advanced features like QR code generation, attendee management, check-in systems, and automatic email confirmations. For simple single-session events, basic Shopify products with time-limited variants can work, but most event organizers benefit from a dedicated ticketing integration that automates QR code generation, attendance tracking, and post-event analytics. The hybrid approach of selling tickets through Shopify while using an app for check-in verification provides the best customer experience and operational efficiency."
  - question: "What are the best Shopify apps for selling event tickets?"
    answer: "The top Shopify ticketing apps include Eventix (comprehensive all-in-one solution with advanced attendee management), Ticketfy (specializes in multi-date and multi-session events with flexible pricing), Ticket Tailor (affordable with strong customer support), Evently (real-time inventory tracking and dynamic pricing), and Ticketsy (streamlined checkout focused on conversion). For workshops and courses, Teachable and Kajabi can integrate with Shopify if you need to combine ticketing with content delivery. The best app depends on your event complexity—simple single-date events work well with basic apps like Ticket Tailor, while multi-track conferences with hundreds of sessions benefit from enterprise solutions like Eventix. Most apps cost $0-50 monthly for basic plans and scale with transaction volume or feature requirements. Test free trials with 2-3 apps to see which integrates most smoothly with your workflow."
  - question: "How do QR code check-in systems work for Shopify events?"
    answer: "QR code check-in works by embedding a unique code in each ticket that attendees either print or receive digitally on their phone. When attendees arrive at your event, your staff scans the QR code with a smartphone app or tablet, which instantly records their attendance, checks them against the registration list, and prevents duplicate entries. Most Shopify ticketing apps—Eventix, Ticketfy, and Ticket Tailor—automatically generate QR codes for each ticket and provide free or low-cost check-in apps for iOS and Android. The QR code should include encrypted data linking to the ticket ID in your ticketing system's database. When scanned, the app queries the database in real-time to verify legitimacy and prevent counterfeiting. For multi-session events, you can configure the system to check attendees into specific sessions, helping you track which sessions had the highest attendance. Most integrated solutions sync check-in data to your dashboard in real-time, giving you live attendance numbers and detailed reports after the event."
  - question: "How do you handle multiple dates and sessions for workshop tickets on Shopify?"
    answer: "Multiple dates and sessions require a product structure that allows customers to select their preferred time slot at checkout. The simplest approach is creating separate products for each date/session combination (Workshop 101 - Friday 2PM, Workshop 101 - Saturday 10AM, etc.), but this clutters your store and duplicates product information. A more elegant solution uses Shopify product variants to group all sessions under one product, with each variant representing a specific date and time. Dedicated ticketing apps like Ticketfy and Eventix handle this automatically through their admin interface—you create the event, add multiple sessions, set inventory for each, and the app manages variant structure behind the scenes. This approach keeps your product catalog clean while giving customers easy date selection. For complex events with hundreds of sessions, the ticketing app should support real-time inventory tracking, sold-out notifications, and automated waitlisting. Post-purchase, your ticketing system should send automated emails with QR codes specific to the purchased session, and your check-in app should verify the attendee is checking in to the correct session."
  - question: "How can you bundle merchandise with ticket sales on Shopify?"
    answer: "Bundling merchandise with tickets increases average order value and enhances attendee experience. The most effective strategies include offering ticket tiers (General Admission, VIP, Premium) where higher tiers automatically include merchandise like t-shirts, hoodies, or event-branded items; creating separate 'Add-on' products that appear at checkout for attendees to bundle with their tickets; or using Shopify's discount/promotion features to create conditional bundles (ticket + merchandise at a discounted rate). For physical bundling, coordinate with your fulfillment process to pack merchandise with printed tickets or include order fulfillment notes reminding your team which attendees have merchandise add-ons. For digital events, bundle digital merchandise like video recordings, workbooks, or digital downloads with ticket purchases using apps like Digital Downloads. The psychological benefit of tiered tickets with included merchandise is substantial—VIP ticket sales increase 40-60% when paired with branded merchandise compared to admission-only options. Track merchandise profitability separately from ticket revenue using Shopify's cost tracking features to understand which bundles drive the highest margins."

Selling event tickets through Shopify has transformed from a workaround into a sophisticated, scalable revenue stream. Whether you are organizing a one-time workshop, a multi-day conference, or a recurring educational series, Shopify combined with specialized ticketing integrations provides everything needed to manage inventory, process payments, generate QR codes, and track attendance—all while collecting valuable attendee data that powers your future marketing.

This guide covers everything event organizers need to know about selling tickets on Shopify, from choosing the right ticketing app to structuring multi-session events, managing check-in, and bundling merchandise with admission to maximize revenue per attendee.

## Why Shopify for Event Ticketing?

Shopify was originally designed for product e-commerce, but it has evolved into a flexible platform capable of selling any digital or physical product—including event tickets. The advantages for event organizers are compelling.

**First, you maintain complete control of your customer data.** Unlike ticketing platforms like Eventbrite that own your attendee email list, Shopify gives you direct access to customer information for future marketing campaigns. After an event, you have a customer database that you can email repeatedly about upcoming events, complementary products, or educational content.

**Second, Shopify integrates seamlessly with your existing business infrastructure.** If you already use Shopify for merchandise sales, you can use the same platform, admin dashboard, and payment processor for tickets. There is no context switching, no separate logins, and no reconciling sales across multiple systems.

**Third, Shopify's pricing scales with your business.** You pay a flat monthly fee ($39-299) plus payment processing fees (2.7-3.5% depending on your plan). You never pay per-ticket commissions like Eventbrite (which charges 3% + $0.99 per ticket). For events with 500+ attendees, Shopify becomes dramatically cheaper than dedicated ticketing platforms.

**Fourth, bundling tickets with merchandise is straightforward.** You can offer ticket tiers that include branded apparel, create add-on products for merchandise, or run promotions that combine admission with event swag. This bundling increases average order value 30-50% compared to ticket-only events.

The main limitation is that Shopify's native product system was not designed for ticketing-specific needs like multi-session management, automated QR code generation, and real-time check-in tracking. This is where specialized ticketing apps fill the gap, transforming Shopify into a enterprise-grade event management platform.

## Setting Up Tickets as Shopify Products

Before selecting a specialized ticketing app, understand how Shopify's product structure handles tickets. This foundation determines whether you need app enhancements.

### Basic Product Configuration

The simplest approach treats each ticket type or date as a separate Shopify product. For a single-date workshop:

- **Product name:** "Workshop 101: Advanced Email Marketing"
- **Price:** $97
- **Product type:** "Workshop" or "Event Ticket"
- **Inventory:** Set initial quantity to available seats (e.g., 100)

Shopify automatically prevents overselling—once inventory reaches zero, the product appears as "Sold Out" on your store.

For the product description, clearly state the event date, time, location or meeting platform (Zoom/in-person), what attendees will learn, who it is for, and what they should bring. This information becomes critical because customers cannot change their mind after purchase—the event has a hard start date.

### Using Variants for Options

If your workshop offers multiple start times or days, use Shopify variants instead of creating separate products. Create a base product "Workshop 101: Advanced Email Marketing" with variants like:

- **Friday, March 7 - 2:00 PM EST**
- **Friday, March 7 - 6:00 PM EST**
- **Saturday, March 8 - 10:00 AM EST**

Each variant has its own inventory count, price (if you offer early bird pricing), and SKU. Customers select their preferred time at checkout, and Shopify tracks inventory separately for each variant.

This approach keeps your product catalog organized while giving customers choice. However, manually creating dozens of variants for a large conference becomes unwieldy—this is where ticketing apps excel.

### Digital Tickets vs. Physical Tickets

Shopify treats tickets differently based on whether they are digital or physical.

**Digital tickets** are sent immediately to the customer's email after purchase. Configure this in Shopify by marking the product as "Digital" (in Shopify admin > Products > Select product > Checkbox: "This is a digital product"). You can attach the ticket file (PDF or link) to the order fulfillment.

**Physical tickets** are printed and shipped or handed out at the event. These are treated as regular physical products with shipping options. Most modern events use digital tickets since printing and shipping adds cost and complexity.

In practice, most Shopify ticketing setups use "digital" products that contain a link to download the ticket PDF or digital wallet entry. The QR code is embedded in this PDF.

## Choosing a Ticketing App

Shopify's app ecosystem includes specialized ticketing apps that extend native product functionality with event management features. The leading options are:

### Eventix

Eventix is the most comprehensive Shopify ticketing app, designed for everything from small workshops to large conferences. It automatically generates QR codes for each ticket, provides a mobile check-in app, tracks real-time attendance, and includes attendee data collection (custom form fields) at checkout.

**Strengths:** Handles unlimited sessions, supports tiered pricing and dynamic pricing, provides detailed attendance analytics, includes email automation for automated confirmations and reminders.

**Pricing:** $49/month base + per-transaction fees (typically 2-3% of ticket sales).

**Best for:** Multi-session events, conferences with complex tiering, organizers who need detailed analytics.

### Ticketfy

Ticketfy specializes in flexible multi-date and multi-session events. It integrates seamlessly with Shopify checkout, generates unique QR codes per ticket, and provides a lightweight check-in app.

**Strengths:** Intuitive event creation, strong customer support, reasonable pricing, excellent for workshops and educational events.

**Pricing:** $0-30/month depending on features + per-ticket commission (typically $0.50-1.50).

**Best for:** Educational workshops, recurring events, organizers seeking simplicity.

### Ticket Tailor

Ticket Tailor is one of the most affordable options and is known for excellent customer support. It offers QR code generation, a check-in app, and basic attendee management.

**Strengths:** Very affordable, simple setup, great documentation, reliable infrastructure.

**Pricing:** Free tier available; paid plans $10-30/month + per-ticket fees.

**Best for:** First-time event organizers, small to mid-size events, budget-conscious organizers.

### Evently

Evently focuses on real-time inventory management and capacity tracking. It integrates with Shopify and prevents overselling even with traffic spikes.

**Strengths:** Real-time inventory sync, capacity-based ticketing, automatic waitlisting.

**Pricing:** $29/month + transaction fees.

**Best for:** Events with strict capacity limits, high-traffic events expecting rapid sellout.

### Ticketsy

Ticketsy is built specifically for Shopify with conversion-focused checkout. It emphasizes reducing friction in the ticket purchase process.

**Strengths:** Minimal checkout steps, fast load times, excellent for driving ticket sales.

**Pricing:** $19/month + transaction fees.

**Best for:** Organizers focused on maximizing ticket sales conversion.

## Implementing QR Codes and Check-In Systems

The real power of Shopify ticket sales emerges when combined with QR codes and digital check-in. This combination solves multiple operational challenges: verifying attendee legitimacy, preventing ticket fraud, tracking attendance by session, and collecting data about which sessions are most popular.

### How QR Codes Are Generated

When you sell a ticket through Shopify paired with a ticketing app, the app automatically generates a unique QR code for that ticket. The QR code encodes ticket metadata:

```
https://check-in.eventix.io?ticket_id=TKT-2026-0001&attendee=John+Smith&event=Workshop101&session=Friday+2PM&hash=abc123def456
```

This URL is converted into a scannable QR code image and included in the ticket PDF sent to the customer. The customer either prints the ticket or displays it on their phone.

### Check-In Workflow

At your event, staff use a check-in app (provided by your ticketing platform) on a smartphone or tablet. The workflow is:

1. **Attendee arrives:** Presents printed or digital ticket with QR code.
2. **Staff scans code:** Uses the ticketing app to scan the QR code.
3. **System verifies:** The app queries your ticketing database to confirm the ticket exists, has not been scanned previously (preventing duplicate entry), and matches the correct session/time.
4. **Attendee is checked in:** The system records the scan timestamp and updates real-time attendance numbers.

Most check-in apps work offline with queued uploads when internet connectivity returns, critical for events with poor WiFi.

### Preventing Fraud and Duplicate Entry

The hash or encryption in the QR code prevents counterfeiting. Someone cannot manually recreate a valid QR code because the ticket ID and other data are encrypted. Scanning the same QR code twice is prevented because the ticketing system marks it as "scanned" after the first check-in.

For high-security events, some ticketing systems support secondary verification (asking attendee for name or ID), but for most educational workshops and admission events, QR code verification alone prevents 99%+ of fraud.

## Handling Multiple Dates and Sessions

Complex events with multiple sessions—like a two-day conference with 20 concurrent sessions—require sophisticated product and inventory management.

### Structural Approaches

**Approach 1: Separate Products per Date**

Create individual Shopify products for each date variant:

- "Workshop 101 - Friday 2:00 PM"
- "Workshop 101 - Friday 6:00 PM"
- "Workshop 101 - Saturday 10:00 AM"

**Pros:** Simple structure, easy to manage inventory independently.

**Cons:** Creates product catalog clutter, makes cross-date promotion difficult, complicates reporting.

**Approach 2: Single Product with Variants**

Create one product "Workshop 101: Advanced Email Marketing" with variants for each date/time combination:

- **Variant 1:** "Friday 2:00 PM EST" (Inventory: 30, Price: $97)
- **Variant 2:** "Friday 6:00 PM EST" (Inventory: 30, Price: $97)
- **Variant 3:** "Saturday 10:00 AM EST" (Inventory: 25, Price: $79 early bird)

**Pros:** Clean product catalog, easy to apply discounts to all sessions, clearer reporting.

**Cons:** Requires manual variant management, scales poorly beyond 20 variants.

**Approach 3: App-Managed Events (Recommended)**

Ticketing apps like Eventix and Ticketfy handle session management within their admin interface. You create the "event" in the app (Workshop 101), add all sessions with dates/times, set inventory per session, and the app automatically manages Shopify product structure.

**Pros:** Scalable to hundreds of sessions, real-time inventory updates, app handles variant complexity.

**Cons:** Requires learning app-specific admin interface.

For any event with more than 5 date/session combinations, Approach 3 (app-managed) becomes the most efficient.

### Real-Time Inventory Management

The critical challenge with multi-session events is preventing overbooking. If your Friday 2:00 PM session has 30 seats and receives 31 orders, you have a problem.

Shopify's native inventory system handles this for individual products/variants, but ticketing apps add sophistication:

- **Real-time capacity tracking:** Prevents overselling even during traffic spikes.
- **Waitlisting:** Automatically moves over-capacity orders to a waitlist and notifies customers if a spot opens.
- **Dynamic pricing:** Increase ticket prices as capacity fills (e.g., $89 at 70% capacity, $109 at 90% capacity) to optimize revenue.
- **Sold-out notifications:** Redirect customers to waitlist or alternative sessions when capacity is reached.

When selecting a ticketing app, verify it provides real-time inventory sync between the app and your Shopify store.

## Combining Merchandise with Ticket Sales

One of Shopify's greatest advantages for event organizers is the ability to seamlessly bundle merchandise (t-shirts, hoodies, workbooks, etc.) with ticket sales. This bundling typically increases average order value 30-50% while enhancing attendee experience.

### Tiered Ticket Strategy

The most effective approach creates ticket tiers with bundled merchandise:

**General Admission - $97**
- Access to all workshop sessions
- Digital workbook PDF
- Event recording access (90 days)

**VIP Admission - $197**
- Everything in General Admission, plus:
- Branded event t-shirt
- Premium digital content (extended access to 1 year)
- 30-minute 1-on-1 coaching session

**Premium Plus - $397**
- Everything in VIP, plus:
- Branded hoodie + t-shirt bundle
- Hardcover workbook (printed and shipped)
- Lifetime access to all resources
- Small group dinner with instructor (night of event)

In Shopify, implement this by creating three separate products (one per tier) OR using variants with different prices and bundle descriptions. In the product description, explicitly list what is included at each tier.

When fulfilling Premium Plus orders, your fulfillment team receives an order note indicating the purchaser should receive printed workbook and apparel. Your ticketing system still manages the digital ticket and QR code.

### Add-On Products at Checkout

Create separate "Add-on" products that appear in Shopify's post-purchase upsell section or in your cart:

- "Event T-Shirt - White (add $19)" - quantity select for multiple shirts
- "Premium Workbook - Printed Edition (add $29)" - shipped to attendee address
- "VIP Networking Dinner Add-on (add $149)" - limited quantity with RSVP

Upselling customers with $20-50 merchandise add-ons increases average order value significantly. A 50-person workshop where 30% add merchandise generates $300-500 in additional revenue.

### Bundling Strategy for Digital Events

For virtual/online events, bundle digital products:

- "Workshop Recording + Workbook Bundle" (included free with paid attendance)
- "Extended Access Add-on" (upgrade to lifetime access for +$39)
- "Certificate of Completion Add-on" (professional certificate for +$19)

Use Shopify apps like Digital Downloads to deliver digital files immediately after purchase.

### Managing Fulfillment

Your fulfillment process must account for merchandise attached to tickets:

1. **Separate merchandise tracking:** Create a fulfillment workflow that flags orders with merchandise bundled to tickets.
2. **Packing instructions:** Your fulfillment system should generate packing slips indicating which orders require apparel, workbooks, or other items.
3. **Timing coordination:** For in-person events, merchandise should be printed/packed before the event and available for attendee pickup. For shipped merchandise, coordinate with your event timing.

For complex events, use Shopify's order management apps (like Printful for print-on-demand merchandise) to automate fulfillment coordination.

## Building a Successful Ticketing Strategy on Shopify

Beyond technical setup, building a profitable event ticketing business on Shopify requires strategic decisions about pricing, inventory allocation, and customer communication.

### Pricing Strategy

Ticket pricing depends on event value, attendee sophistication, and market competition. General guidelines:

- **Educational workshops:** $49-249 per attendee depending on depth and instructor reputation
- **Multi-day conferences:** $299-1,499 for passes
- **Networking events:** $29-99 depending on exclusive nature
- **Premium/VIP tiers:** Price 2-4x the general admission price

Most events see higher conversion with tiered pricing (general + VIP) rather than a single price point. The VIP tier should include at least one differentiating element (merchandise, exclusive content, 1-on-1 time) worth 2-3x the price difference.

If you run events on [Shopify](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624), you can A/B test pricing easily by creating variant products at different price points and monitoring conversion rates across test periods.

### Early Bird Pricing and Scarcity

Implement early-bird pricing (e.g., $79 for first 50 tickets, regular $99 afterward) to drive early commitment and generate marketing momentum. This works particularly well for multi-session events where visible availability creates urgency.

Scarcity messaging ("Only 12 seats remaining for Friday 2:00 PM session") increases conversion 20-30% when inventory is actually limited. Only use scarcity messaging when truthfully displaying remaining capacity.

### Email Automation and Attendee Communication

Post-purchase, automated emails are critical for attendee experience and event success:

1. **Purchase confirmation (immediate):** Includes ticket PDF with QR code, download links, and event details.
2. **Week-before reminder:** Reinforces event date/time, login instructions for virtual events, or parking/location info for in-person.
3. **Day-before reminder:** Final confirmation with last-minute logistics.
4. **Post-event thank you:** Includes survey link, access to recordings/resources, and upsell to next event.

Use Shopify's built-in email functionality or integrate with Klaviyo (email marketing platform) for more sophisticated automation. Reminder emails increase attendance rates 15-25% for paid events.

### Repeat Event Optimization

When running recurring events, build on successful events:

1. **Survey attendees post-event:** Gather feedback on quality, timing, pacing, and content preferences for future sessions.
2. **Create alumni email list:** Segment customers who have purchased tickets to previous events and offer exclusive early-bird access to new sessions.
3. **Track session popularity:** Analyze which date/times and topics generate highest demand to optimize future scheduling.
4. **Build a product sequence:** Once customers purchase one workshop, offer progressively advanced sessions in a natural progression (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced).

This creates predictable recurring revenue where customers increasingly become repeat attendees and spend more per event through VIP upgrades and merchandise bundles.

## Technical Integration and Best Practices

### Integration Checklist

Before launching ticket sales, verify these integrations:

- **Payment processing:** Confirm Shopify Payments or your payment processor (Stripe, PayPal) supports your event's currency and customer base.
- **Email service:** Test that order confirmation emails include ticket PDFs with correctly generated QR codes.
- **Ticketing app sync:** Verify inventory in the ticketing app matches Shopify product inventory within 60 seconds of a purchase.
- **Check-in app:** Test QR code scanning on multiple devices to confirm reliability.
- **Analytics:** Set up Shopify pixel or UTM tracking to measure ticket source (organic search, email, ads, etc.).

### Scaling Considerations

As your event grows from 50 to 500+ attendees:

- **Check-in infrastructure:** Plan for multiple check-in stations with separate devices/networks to handle parallel attendee flow.
- **Backup systems:** Have printed attendance lists and manual check-in procedures in case your digital check-in fails.
- **Customer support:** Expect ticket-related support questions (download issues, registration changes, payment questions). Set expectations for response time.
- **Payment processing:** Confirm your payment processor can handle transaction volume without delays. Most processors handle 100+ payments/minute without issue.

For enterprise events (1000+ attendees), consider upgrading to Shopify Plus (enterprise plan) which offers dedicated support and higher transaction limits.

## Maximizing Revenue Beyond Tickets

Event organizers on Shopify often discover that ticket sales are just the beginning. The attendee audience becomes a customer base for additional revenue streams:

### Post-Event Digital Products

Record your event and sell the recording ($19-49 for attendees, $39-79 for non-attendees). Create a "resources" page with downloadable checklists, templates, and guides related to event content ($19-99 each).

### Physical Products and Merchandise

Extend your merchandise beyond event bundles. Create evergreen branded products (t-shirts, mugs, hoodies) that appeal to your attendee audience beyond the specific event.

### Coaching and Consulting

Use your event as a lead generation tool for higher-ticket coaching or consulting services. Attendees who enjoy your event become pre-qualified leads for $500-5000+ offers.

### Email List Building

Every ticket purchase captures an email address. Build this list intentionally through post-event emails that offer incentives for subscribing (exclusive tips, discounts on future events, merchandise).

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Ticket Exchange and Refunds

Establish clear refund policy (e.g., "Full refund if cancelled 14 days before event, 50% refund within 7 days, no refund within 48 hours"). Document this in product description and confirmation emails.

For attendee changes (attendee cannot attend but wants to transfer ticket to someone else), your ticketing app should support name changes or ticket transfers. This prevents refund fraud while maintaining goodwill.

### No-Shows and Attendance Tracking

Expect 10-20% no-show rates for free/low-cost events, 5-10% for paid events, and 1-3% for premium/VIP events. Use this data for future event sizing—if 100 tickets sell, expect 80-90 attendees for a $100+ paid event.

Track attendance by session to understand which topics, times, and instructors drive highest attendance. This data becomes invaluable for future event planning.

### Technical Issues During Event

Anticipate that some attendees will have issues downloading their ticket PDF, displaying QR codes on their phone, or using the check-in app. Prepare:

- **Backup printed tickets:** Print a list of registered attendees for manual check-in if your digital system fails.
- **Guest WiFi with high capacity:** Ensure your event venue has reliable internet for attendee access.
- **Support contact:** Provide attendee support phone number in confirmation email for last-minute issues.

### Handling Cancellations and Rescheduling

If you need to cancel or reschedule an event, communicate immediately via email with refund information. Offer full refunds for cancellations and either refunds or credit toward future events for rescheduled dates.

Shopify's app ecosystem includes refund management apps that automate full/partial refunds at scale.

## Getting Started: Action Plan

1. **Audit your event:** Document the date(s), time(s), capacity, and pricing structure.
2. **Set up Shopify products:** Create your ticket products with appropriate variants for multiple dates/times.
3. **Select and install a ticketing app:** Test 2-3 apps using their free trial to assess usability.
4. **Configure email automation:** Set up post-purchase confirmation, reminders, and post-event emails.
5. **Test the full workflow:** Purchase a test ticket, verify QR code generation, download the PDF, and test check-in app scanning.
6. **Set up analytics:** Track ticket sales by source and conversion rate.
7. **Launch with early bird pricing:** Create marketing campaign driving early ticket sales and momentum.
8. **Execute the event:** Use check-in app to track real-time attendance.
9. **Analyze results:** Document attendance by session, revenue per attendee, no-show rates, and customer feedback for next event.

## Conclusion

Selling event tickets on [Shopify](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624) eliminates the complexity and cost barriers that previously made event ticketing only viable for large organizations. Whether you are running a $97 online workshop, a $299 multi-day conference, or a premium $497 immersive experience, Shopify provides the payment processing, inventory management, and attendee communication infrastructure needed at a fraction of the cost of dedicated ticketing platforms.

The merchants and event organizers scaling the fastest are combining Shopify's flexibility with specialized ticketing apps, strategically bundling merchandise with admission, and using attendee data to build repeat-purchase relationships that extend far beyond a single event.
