## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool that integrates Claude AI directly into your development workflow. Unlike IDE extensions that provide autocomplete suggestions, Claude Code is a terminal-based agentic system that can:

- **Read and understand** your entire codebase
- **Write and edit** code across multiple files
- **Run terminal commands** including git, npm, and other CLI tools
- **Search and analyze** code patterns and architecture
- **Execute complex workflows** with multi-step planning
- **Integrate with external tools** via MCP servers

### The Agentic Difference

What sets Claude Code apart is its agentic nature. When you ask Claude Code to "add user authentication," it doesn't just suggest code snippets—it:

1. Analyzes your current architecture
2. Plans the necessary changes across multiple files
3. Creates or modifies routes, models, controllers, and tests
4. Executes the changes with checkpoints
5. Lets you review diffs before accepting

This agentic approach means Claude Code can handle tasks that would require dozens of manual edits and context switches.

## Getting Started with Claude Code

### Installation

Claude Code is available through npm:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Or via your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn global add @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Using pnpm
pnpm add -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Initial Setup

After installation, authenticate with your Anthropic account:

```bash
claude-code auth
```

This will open your browser to complete authentication. Once authenticated, you can start a Claude Code session:

```bash
claude-code
```

### Configuration

Claude Code can be configured via environment variables or a config file. Common configurations include:

**Model Selection:**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL=claude-opus-4-5-20251101
```

**Project-Specific Settings:**
Create a `.claude-code/config.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "defaultModel": "sonnet",
  "autoSave": true,
  "contextWindow": "large"
}
```

## Core Features and Capabilities

### Understanding Your Codebase

Claude Code's first superpower is codebase understanding. When you start a session, Claude analyzes your project structure, dependencies, and code patterns. This allows it to:

- **Navigate complex architectures** across hundreds of files
- **Understand relationships** between modules, components, and services
- **Respect conventions** established in your codebase
- **Maintain consistency** with existing patterns

### Multi-File Editing

Unlike traditional assistants that work on single files, Claude Code excels at multi-file refactoring:

```
User: "Refactor the user service to use dependency injection"

Claude Code:
- Analyzes UserService.ts and its dependencies
- Updates UserController.ts to pass dependencies
- Modifies tests in UserService.test.ts
- Updates dependency injection container in di-container.ts
- Creates migration guide in CHANGELOG.md
```

Each change is presented as a diff you can review and accept or reject individually.

### Terminal Command Execution

Claude Code can run terminal commands directly, making it a true development partner:

- **Git workflows**: commit, branch, merge, rebase
- **Package management**: install, update, audit dependencies
- **Testing**: run test suites, coverage reports
- **Build tools**: compile, bundle, deploy
- **Custom scripts**: any CLI tool you use

### Extended Thinking

One of Claude Code's most powerful features is "extended thinking"—enabled by default. Before making changes, Claude reasons through:

- Architectural implications
- Edge cases and potential bugs
- Alternative approaches
- Testing requirements

This results in higher-quality code that considers consequences beyond the immediate task.

## Advanced Features

### Slash Commands

Claude Code includes built-in slash commands for common workflows:

- `/commit` - Create git commits with AI-generated messages
- `/review-pr` - Review pull requests and provide feedback
- `/test` - Generate test cases for code
- `/refactor` - Refactor code with architectural improvements
- `/explain` - Explain complex code or patterns
- `/rewind` - Undo code changes and revert conversation

Custom slash commands can be created to automate project-specific workflows.

### Subagents

Subagents are specialized Claude instances with their own context windows and personas. Use them for domain-specific tasks:

**Code Review Subagent:**
```bash
/subagent create reviewer --persona "Senior engineer focused on code quality, security, and maintainability"
```

**Architecture Subagent:**
```bash
/subagent create architect --persona "System architect specializing in scalable distributed systems"
```

Subagents save tokens by maintaining focused context and provide better results for specialized tasks.

### Hooks: Automation and Enforcement

Hooks allow you to automate workflows and enforce standards. They communicate through stdout, stderr, and exit codes, providing deterministic control over Claude Code's behavior.

**Example: Pre-Commit Hook**

Create `.claude-code/hooks/pre-commit.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run linting before commits
npm run lint

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Linting failed. Fix errors before committing."
  exit 1
fi

# Run tests
npm test

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Tests failed. Fix tests before committing."
  exit 1
fi

exit 0
```

This hook ensures code quality before any commit Claude Code creates.

**When to Use Hooks:**

- **Quality gates**: enforce linting, formatting, tests
- **Security checks**: scan for secrets, vulnerabilities
- **Documentation**: auto-generate docs on code changes
- **Notifications**: alert team members of significant changes

### MCP Servers: External Integrations

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend Claude Code's capabilities by integrating external systems. Popular MCP servers include:

**GitHub Integration:**
```bash
claude-code mcp install github
```

Enables Claude to:
- Create and review pull requests
- Manage issues
- Check CI/CD status
- Review code comments

**Database Integration:**
```bash
claude-code mcp install postgres
```

Allows Claude to:
- Query databases
- Generate migrations
- Analyze schema
- Optimize queries

**Custom MCP Servers:**

You can build custom MCP servers for internal tools:

```typescript
// mcp-server-internal-api.ts
import { MCPServer } from '@anthropic-ai/mcp';

const server = new MCPServer({
  name: 'internal-api',
  version: '1.0.0',
  capabilities: {
    resources: {
      'api/users': {
        read: async () => {
          // Fetch from internal API
          return await fetchUsers();
        }
      }
    }
  }
});

server.start();
```

**When to Use MCP:**

- Integrate external systems as native commands
- Connect APIs, databases, cloud services
- Provide Claude context from proprietary tools
- Expose internal documentation and data

### Background Commands

As of 2026, Claude Code supports background command execution with Ctrl+B. This is perfect for:

- Running dev servers while you continue working
- Long-running test suites
- Build and compilation processes
- Deployment scripts

Claude notifies you when background commands complete, so you can focus on other tasks without waiting.

## Claude Code vs. GitHub Copilot

Many developers wonder how Claude Code compares to GitHub Copilot. The truth is they serve different purposes:

| Feature | Claude Code | GitHub Copilot |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Approach** | Agentic, multi-file system | IDE autocomplete |
| **Best for** | Complex refactoring, architecture | Fast code completion |
| **Context** | Entire repository | Current file + nearby files |
| **Workflow** | Task-based (fix bug, add feature) | Line-by-line suggestions |
| **Integration** | Terminal-based | IDE-embedded |
| **Planning** | Multi-step execution | Immediate suggestions |
| **Code quality** | More secure code (75% of cases) | Fast generation (92% accuracy) |
| **Latency** | 60ms p99 | 43ms average |
| **Price** | Varies by plan | $10/month or $100/year |

**The Bottom Line:**

Many teams run both deliberately—Copilot as the IDE autopilot for fast completions, Claude Code as the problem-solving and refactor engine for complex tasks.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Large-Scale Refactoring

**Scenario:** Migrate from REST API to GraphQL

```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Conversations with Context

Give Claude Code clear context:

```
Good: "Add user authentication using JWT. We're using Express and PostgreSQL. Follow the auth pattern from the admin service."

Less effective: "Add auth"
```

### 2. Review Diffs Carefully

Claude Code presents changes as diffs. Always review before accepting:

- Check for unintended side effects
- Verify edge cases are handled
- Ensure tests are comprehensive
- Confirm documentation is updated

### 3. Use Subagents for Specialized Tasks

Don't ask general Claude to do specialized work:

```
Good:
/subagent create security --persona "Security engineer"
@security "Review this authentication code for vulnerabilities"

Less effective:
"Check if this auth code is secure"
```

### 4. Leverage Hooks for Consistency

Set up hooks to enforce team standards automatically:

- Pre-commit: linting, formatting, tests
- Pre-push: build verification, security scans
- Post-merge: documentation generation

### 5. Integrate with Your Tools

Install MCP servers for tools you use daily:

- GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
- Your database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
- CI/CD platforms (Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions)
- Internal APIs and documentation

### 6. Monitor Costs

Claude Code now shows real-time session costs in the status line. Monitor usage to:

- Optimize which model you use (Haiku for simple tasks, Opus for complex)
- Review token-heavy operations
- Educate team on cost-effective practices

## Team Collaboration

### Shared Configurations

Teams can share Claude Code configurations via version control:

```
.claude-code/

    ├── reviewer.json
    └── architect.json
```

Commit this directory to ensure consistency across the team.

### Documentation as Code

Use Claude Code to maintain living documentation:

```
User: "Update architecture docs based on recent service changes"

Claude Code:
1. Analyzes service changes in recent commits
2. Updates architecture diagrams (if using diagram-as-code)
3. Revises API documentation
4. Updates deployment guides
5. Adds migration notes
```

### Knowledge Sharing

Create custom slash commands for onboarding:

```bash
/explain-architecture
