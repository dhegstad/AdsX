faqs:
  - question: "Can I connect my Etsy shop directly to Shopify?"
    answer: "Shopify previously offered a native Etsy sales channel, but this has been deprecated. In 2026, the best approach is using third-party integration tools like LitCommerce, Sellbrite, or Codisto. These tools connect both platforms, sync inventory in real-time, and centralize order management so you can sell on both Etsy and Shopify without manual double-entry."
  - question: "Should I charge the same prices on Etsy and Shopify?"
    answer: "Not necessarily. Many sellers price slightly higher on Etsy (5-15%) to account for Etsy's transaction and payment fees (which total approximately 11-12%), then offer the same or slightly lower prices on Shopify where you only pay payment processing fees. Some sellers use identical pricing for brand consistency. Consider your customer overlap and test both approaches."
  - question: "How do I prevent overselling when selling on multiple platforms?"
    answer: "Use a multi-channel integration tool with real-time inventory sync. Tools like Sellbrite, LitCommerce, and Codisto automatically update inventory across Etsy and Shopify whenever a sale occurs on either platform. Set safety stock buffers (2-5 units) for popular items to account for sync delays during high-traffic periods."
  - question: "Which products should I sell on Etsy vs. Shopify?"
    answer: "List all products on both platforms, but understand each platform's strengths. Etsy excels at handmade, vintage, unique, and gift-oriented products where buyers expect to discover new artisans. Shopify is better for building a branded experience, subscription products, bundles, and repeat customers. Use Etsy for discovery and new customer acquisition; use Shopify for building direct customer relationships."
  - question: "How long does it take to set up Etsy-Shopify integration?"
    answer: "Most sellers can complete basic integration in 2-4 hours. This includes connecting accounts, mapping products, setting up inventory sync, and configuring order management. Allow an additional week to fine-tune inventory buffers, test order flows, and establish customer service workflows. Full optimization with pricing strategy and product selection typically takes 2-4 weeks of iterative testing."

For years, Etsy sellers have debated whether to expand to Shopify. The marketplace that launched countless handmade businesses also takes a growing cut of every sale. But abandoning Etsy means walking away from built-in traffic and trusted brand recognition.

The answer is not either/or. The smartest Etsy sellers in 2026 are running both platforms simultaneously, using Etsy for discovery and customer acquisition while building direct relationships through their Shopify stores. This multi-channel approach diversifies revenue, reduces platform dependence, and positions sellers for long-term growth.

This guide covers everything you need to sell on both Etsy and Shopify: integration tools, inventory sync, order management, pricing strategies, and the path from Etsy-primary to Shopify-primary selling.

## Why Sell on Both Etsy and Shopify

### The Danger of Single-Platform Dependence

Every successful Etsy seller eventually confronts an uncomfortable truth: your business depends entirely on decisions made by a company you do not control.

**Recent Etsy changes that impacted sellers:**
- Fee increases from 5% to 6.5% transaction fees (plus payment processing)
- Star Seller program requirements affecting search visibility
- Algorithm changes shifting traffic to Etsy Ads and promoted listings
- Policy enforcement inconsistencies causing listing suspensions
- Increased competition from resellers and mass-produced goods

When your entire income flows through one platform, any change can devastate your business overnight. Multi-channel selling is insurance against platform risk.

### The Strategic Case for Both Platforms

Etsy and Shopify serve fundamentally different roles in your business:

| Aspect | Etsy | Shopify |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Traffic Source** | Built-in marketplace traffic | You drive your own traffic |
| **Customer Relationship** | Etsy owns the customer | You own the customer |
| **Discovery** | Excellent for new customers | Requires marketing investment |
| **Fees** | ~11-12% all-in per transaction | ~2.9% + $0.30 payment processing |
| **Email Marketing** | Limited/prohibited | Full control |
| **Brand Building** | Within Etsy's framework | Complete brand control |
| **Repeat Purchases** | Harder to drive | Easier with email/SMS |

**The ideal setup:** Use Etsy to get discovered by new customers, then convert them to Shopify customers for repeat purchases and higher lifetime value.

### Real Numbers: The Fee Comparison

Let us examine a $50 product sale on each platform:

**Etsy Fee Breakdown:**
- Transaction fee (6.5%): $3.25
- Payment processing (3% + $0.25): $1.75
- Listing fee: $0.20
- Offsite Ads (if applicable, 12-15%): $0-$7.50
- **Total Etsy fees: $5.20-$12.70**

**Shopify Fee Breakdown (Basic plan):**
- Shopify Payments (2.9% + $0.30): $1.75
- Subscription (prorated): ~$1.00
- **Total Shopify fees: ~$2.75**

The fee difference of $2.45-$9.95 per sale adds up dramatically at scale. On $100,000 annual revenue, you could save $2,450-$9,950 by shifting sales to Shopify.

## Setting Up Etsy-Shopify Integration

### The Current State of Native Integration

Shopify previously offered a native Etsy sales channel that allowed direct integration. Unfortunately, this integration was deprecated, leaving sellers to rely on third-party solutions.

**What the native channel offered:**
- Direct product sync
- Unified order management
- Inventory synchronization
- Listing management from Shopify

**Current reality (2026):** Third-party integration tools now fill this gap, often with superior features and reliability compared to the original native integration.

### Third-Party Integration Tools Compared

### Step-by-Step Integration Setup

**Phase 1: Account Connection (30 minutes)**

1. Sign up for your chosen integration tool
2. Connect your Shopify store (requires admin access)
3. Connect your Etsy shop (OAuth authorization)
4. Verify both connections are active

**Phase 2: Product Import and Mapping (1-2 hours)**

1. Import existing Etsy listings into the integration tool
2. Review product data mapping (titles, descriptions, variants)
3. Set up category mapping between platforms
4. Configure variant and option handling
5. Review and adjust product images

**Phase 3: Inventory Configuration (30 minutes)**

1. Set your current inventory levels as the source of truth
2. Configure sync direction (bidirectional recommended)
3. Set safety stock buffers for popular items
4. Test sync by adjusting inventory manually
5. Verify changes reflect on both platforms

**Phase 4: Order Management Setup (30 minutes)**

1. Configure order import settings
2. Set up fulfillment workflows
3. Connect shipping carriers
4. Test order flow with a sample purchase
5. Verify tracking updates sync correctly

## Mastering Inventory Sync

### Why Inventory Sync Is Critical

Overselling is the nightmare scenario for multi-channel sellers. A customer orders your last item on Etsy while another customer simultaneously orders on Shopify. Now you have two orders and one product.

**Consequences of overselling:**
- Cancelled orders damage seller metrics
- Refund processing costs time and money
- Negative reviews hurt visibility
- Customer trust is difficult to rebuild

### Real-Time Sync vs. Scheduled Sync

**Real-time sync** updates inventory within seconds of a sale. Most integration tools now offer this as standard.

**Scheduled sync** updates inventory at intervals (every 15 minutes, hourly, etc.). This is risky for fast-selling items.

**Recommendation:** Always use real-time sync if available. The small additional cost is worth avoiding overselling disasters.

### Safety Stock Strategies

Even with real-time sync, edge cases can cause problems. Safety stock buffers protect you.

**Conservative approach:** Hold back 10-20% of inventory from each channel

**Balanced approach:** Hold back 2-5 units of popular items

**Aggressive approach:** List full inventory on both platforms, rely on sync

**Our recommendation:** Start conservative, then loosen buffers as you build confidence in your sync reliability.

### Managing Made-to-Order Products

Many Etsy sellers offer made-to-order products, which simplifies inventory management significantly.

**Best practices for made-to-order:**
- Set inventory as "unlimited" or high number on both platforms
- Use processing time settings accurately on each platform
- Communicate realistic timelines to customers
- Consider separate SKUs for rush orders

### Handling Low Stock Alerts

Configure alerts in your integration tool:

| Stock Level | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| 10 units | Warning notification |
| 5 units | Urgent alert + consider pausing promotions |
| 2 units | Consider removing from one platform |
| 0 units | Automatic listing deactivation |

## Order Management Across Channels

### Centralized Order Dashboard

Your integration tool should provide a single dashboard showing all orders regardless of source. This is essential for efficiency.

**What to look for:**
- Order source clearly labeled (Etsy vs. Shopify)
- Unified fulfillment workflow
- Batch shipping label printing
- Automated tracking upload to both platforms

### Processing Orders Efficiently

**Daily workflow:**

1. **Morning:** Review all new orders in centralized dashboard
2. **Batch processing:** Group orders by shipping method
3. **Production:** Create made-to-order items
4. **Packing:** Use consistent packaging across channels
5. **Shipping:** Print labels in batch, upload tracking
6. **End of day:** Verify all tracking synced correctly

### Platform-Specific Requirements

Each platform has requirements that affect order processing:

**Etsy Requirements:**
- Ship within stated processing time or mark shipped
- Provide tracking for Star Seller eligibility
- Respond to messages within 24 hours
- Handle Etsy-specific return policies

**Shopify Requirements:**
- Fulfill orders to trigger shipping notifications
- Update customers on delays proactively
- Honor your stated shipping policies
- Process refunds through Shopify admin

### Handling Returns Across Platforms

Returns can get complicated with multi-channel selling.

**Best practice:** Process returns through the platform where the purchase occurred.

**Return workflow:**
1. Customer initiates return on purchase platform
2. Issue refund or exchange through that platform
3. Integration tool adjusts inventory automatically
4. Document return reason for product improvement

## Pricing Strategy: Same or Different?

### The Case for Same Prices

**Pros:**
- Consistent brand perception
- No customer confusion if they find you on both platforms
- Simpler management
- Avoids "shopping" between your own channels

**When to use:** If you have significant customer overlap or strong brand recognition, price consistency builds trust.

### The Case for Different Prices

**Pros:**
- Account for different fee structures
- Optimize for each platform's customer expectations
- Fund Etsy advertising from higher prices
- Offer Shopify exclusives at lower prices

**Typical approach:** Price 5-15% higher on Etsy to offset higher fees.

**Example:**

| Product | Shopify Price | Etsy Price | Reasoning |
|---------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Handmade mug | $35 | $38 | Accounts for ~$3 fee difference |
| Custom jewelry | $150 | $165 | 10% markup covers fees + Offsite Ads |
| Digital download | $12 | $12 | Minimal fee difference |

### Implementing Price Differences

Most integration tools let you set price rules:

- **Markup by percentage:** Etsy prices = Shopify prices + 10%
- **Markup by fixed amount:** Etsy prices = Shopify prices + $5
- **Custom per-product:** Set individual prices for each platform

**Warning:** If you use different prices, customers who find you on both platforms may feel deceived. Consider transparent messaging: "Shop direct on our website for the best prices."

### Promotional Pricing Strategies

**Etsy sales:** Use Etsy's built-in sale features to drive traffic
**Shopify discounts:** Offer email subscriber discounts
**Cross-platform consideration:** If running a sale on one platform, consider whether to match on the other

## Which Products on Which Platform

### Understanding Platform Strengths

**Products that perform well on Etsy:**
- Unique, handmade items
- Personalized and custom products
- Gifts and occasion-based purchases
- Vintage and one-of-a-kind items
- Craft supplies and tools
- Items with strong visual appeal

**Products that perform well on Shopify:**
- Repeat-purchase consumables
- Product bundles and sets
- Subscription boxes
- Higher-priced items
- Items requiring detailed product education
- Products with complex variants

### List Everything on Both Platforms

Despite platform strengths, the general rule is: list all products on both platforms. Here is why:

1. **You cannot predict what sells where:** Customers surprise you
2. **More listings = more visibility:** Especially on Etsy
3. **Integration makes it easy:** No extra work to maintain
4. **Data drives decisions:** Let actual sales inform your strategy

### Platform-Exclusive Strategies

Some sellers strategically offer exclusives:

**Shopify exclusives:**
- Subscriber-only products
- Bundles not available on Etsy
- Limited editions announced to email list
- "Website only" special pricing

**Etsy exclusives:**
- Products specifically optimized for Etsy search
- Gift-focused variations
- Lower-priced entry products to capture new customers

### Using Data to Optimize

After 3-6 months of multi-channel selling, analyze:

| Metric | What it tells you |
|--------|-------------------|
| Revenue by platform | Where your money comes from |
| Units sold by product by platform | What sells where |
| Average order value by platform | Customer behavior differences |
| Customer acquisition cost | True cost to acquire each customer |
| Repeat purchase rate by platform | Customer lifetime value |

Use this data to shift focus and marketing spend accordingly.

## Managing Customer Service Across Both

### Communication Expectations by Platform

**Etsy:**
- Customers expect responses within 24 hours (Star Seller requires this)
- Messages come through Etsy's system
- Buyers may have marketplace-specific questions
- Review responses are public and important

**Shopify:**
- Expectations depend on your stated policies
- Communication via email (you control the experience)
- Customers often have direct relationship questions
- More flexibility in how you respond

### Creating Unified Customer Service

**Option 1: Platform-native responses**
Respond to Etsy customers through Etsy, Shopify customers through email. Simple but requires monitoring multiple inboxes.

**Option 2: Help desk integration**
Tools like Gorgias, Zendesk, or Freshdesk can pull in messages from both platforms into one inbox.

**Our recommendation:** Start with platform-native responses. Invest in help desk software when volume exceeds 20+ daily messages.

### Response Templates That Work

Create templates for common questions, adapted for each platform:

**Shipping inquiry (Etsy):**
> "Thanks for reaching out! Your order shipped on [DATE] via [CARRIER]. You can track it here: [LINK]. Most orders arrive within [TIMEFRAME]. Let me know if you have any questions!"

**Shipping inquiry (Shopify):**
> "Hi [NAME], thanks for your order! I shipped your [PRODUCT] on [DATE]. Here's your tracking link: [LINK]. You should receive it by [DATE]. Feel free to reply to this email if you need anything!"

### Handling Platform-Specific Issues

**Etsy cases:** Respond promptly and professionally; Etsy monitors seller responses

**Shopify chargebacks:** Document everything; use Shopify's chargeback response tools

**Review management:** Respond to all Etsy reviews; showcase Shopify reviews on your site

## Scaling from Etsy-Primary to Shopify-Primary

### The Transition Roadmap

Most sellers follow this progression:

**Stage 1: Etsy Only** (0-$50K revenue)
- Learning product-market fit
- Building inventory and processes
- Establishing customer reviews

**Stage 2: Etsy + Shopify** (Equal focus)
- Capturing customer data
- Building email list
- Testing direct marketing

**Stage 3: Shopify Primary, Etsy Secondary** ($100K+ revenue)
- Most revenue from Shopify/direct
- Etsy for discovery and acquisition
- Strong email marketing program

**Stage 4: Shopify Dominant** (Scaled business)
- Etsy as one of many acquisition channels
- Full control of customer relationships
- Diversified marketing portfolio

### Building Your Email List

The key to transitioning is capturing customer data for direct marketing.

**From Etsy:**
- Include branded inserts in packages
- Thank you cards with website URL
- Exclusive discount codes for website signup
- Social media links leading to email capture

**From Shopify:**
- Exit-intent popups
- Checkout opt-ins
- Post-purchase email sequences
- SMS capture for urgent communications

**Email list benchmarks:**
- Aim to capture 30-50% of customers for email
- Expect 15-25% email open rates
- Target 2-5% click-through rates
- Repeat purchase emails should drive 20%+ of revenue

### Marketing Your Shopify Store

Once you have customer data, drive traffic directly to Shopify:

**Owned channels:**
- Email marketing (weekly or biweekly)
- SMS for sales and launches
- Social media (Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok)

**Paid channels:**
- Meta (Facebook/Instagram) ads
- Pinterest ads
- Google Shopping
- Influencer partnerships

**Content marketing:**
- Blog posts on your site
- YouTube product content
- Pinterest pins driving to products

### When to Reduce Etsy Presence

Some sellers eventually scale back Etsy. Signs it is time:

- Shopify revenue exceeds 70% of total
- Etsy fees exceed customer acquisition cost of other channels
- Etsy policy changes significantly harm your business
- Customer service burden on Etsy outweighs benefits

**How to scale back:**
1. Stop renewing low-performing listings
2. Increase Etsy prices to offset fees
3. Remove products with minimal Etsy sales
4. Keep best-performing discovery products
5. Use Etsy purely for new customer acquisition
