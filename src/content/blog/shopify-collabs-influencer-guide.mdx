  - question: "What is Shopify Collabs and how does it differ from traditional affiliate programs?"
    answer: "Shopify Collabs is an integrated platform within Shopify that makes it easy to recruit creators, manage partnerships, and track performance. Unlike traditional affiliate programs that require third-party setup and manual payment processing, Shopify Collabs automates commission tracking, provides built-in creator discovery tools, and offers transparent analytics. Creators can discover your store, see potential earnings, and activate collaboration links directly through the platform—reducing friction and accelerating partnership growth."
  - question: "How do I find the right influencers for my Shopify store?"
    answer: "Look beyond follower counts. Use Shopify Collabs' built-in creator discovery to identify creators whose audiences align with your products and brand values. Analyze their engagement rates (comments, shares, saves), audience demographics, and past brand partnerships. Research their content quality and authenticity. Join creator networks in your niche, monitor relevant hashtags and trending sounds, and engage with creators already discussing products in your category. Start with micro-influencers (10K-100K followers) who often have higher engagement and lower rates than celebrities."
  - question: "What commission structure should I offer to creators?"
    answer: "Commission rates typically range from 5-30% depending on your product margins, industry standards, and creator tier. Micro-influencers often accept 10-15%, mid-tier creators expect 15-20%, and established influencers may negotiate 20-30% or flat fees. Consider offering performance bonuses for exceeding sales targets, tiered rates for volume, or hybrid models combining base fees plus commission. Test different structures, track ROI by creator, and adjust rates based on performance data. Your margins must support the commission while maintaining profitability."
  - question: "How do I measure if influencer partnerships are actually profitable?"
    answer: "Track multiple metrics beyond vanity numbers: attributed sales (using unique discount codes and trackable links), return on ad spend (ROAS), customer acquisition cost (CAC), customer lifetime value (CLV), and repeat purchase rates. Use UTM parameters, affiliate links, and unique coupon codes to precisely attribute revenue. Analyze which creators drive quality customers who have higher lifetime value versus one-time buyers. Compare influencer marketing ROI against other channels. Set clear KPIs before launching partnerships—aim for positive ROAS immediately and improving margins over time."
  - question: "What are common mistakes brands make when managing creator relationships?"
    answer: "The biggest mistakes include: not paying creators on time (damages your reputation), ignoring contract terms and disclosure requirements (legal liability), micromanaging creative content (reduces authenticity), not providing adequate product/brand information (weak promotion), failing to communicate expectations upfront, treating all creators the same regardless of tier, and not following up after success (missing relationship building). Build long-term relationships by being professional, communicating clearly, respecting creators' autonomy, honoring agreements, and rewarding top performers with exclusivity, early product access, or increased compensation."

Influencer marketing has become a cornerstone of e-commerce growth. When done right, partnering with creators can dramatically amplify your reach, build authentic brand advocacy, and drive consistent revenue. Yet many Shopify merchants struggle with the operational complexity of finding, onboarding, and managing influencer partnerships.

**Enter Shopify Collabs**—a purpose-built platform that transforms influencer marketing from a fragmented, manual process into a streamlined, data-driven operation.

This comprehensive guide walks you through every aspect of Shopify Collabs: from understanding the platform to discovering creators, structuring profitable commissions, building lasting relationships, and measuring ROI. Whether you're launching your first influencer campaign or scaling an existing program, you'll find actionable strategies grounded in what actually works.

## What Is Shopify Collabs and Why It Matters

**Shopify Collabs** is an integrated creator management platform built directly into Shopify that automates the entire lifecycle of influencer partnerships. It connects your store with creators actively seeking brand partnerships, manages commission structures, tracks performance, and handles payouts—all without leaving your Shopify admin.

### How Shopify Collabs Works

The platform operates on a simple principle: democratize creator access and reduce friction for both brands and creators.

**For brands:** You set up your collaboration program with commission rates, brand guidelines, and partnership expectations. Shopify Collabs makes your store discoverable to creators seeking partnerships and handles technical integration (tracking links, commission calculations, analytics).

**For creators:** They browse available collaboration opportunities, see your store details, understand earning potential, and activate partnerships without complex onboarding or paperwork.

This bi-directional marketplace approach has fundamentally changed creator recruitment. Instead of brands chasing creators, both parties can find each other directly.

### Key Advantages Over Traditional Affiliate Programs

| Feature | Shopify Collabs | Traditional Affiliate Programs |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Discovery** | Creators find you organically | You must recruit manually |
| **Setup Time** | Minutes | Days or weeks |
| **Commission Tracking** | Fully automated | Manual or unreliable third-party |
| **Creator Vetting** | Built-in profile verification | Your responsibility |
| **Payment Processing** | Automated, integrated | External payment processor |
| **Analytics** | Real-time, creator-level | Limited or fragmented |
| **Creator Incentive** | Earn with first promotion | Join before earning visibility |
| **Contract Management** | Standardized terms | Manual agreements per creator |

For Shopify merchants, Collabs eliminates the operational overhead that makes traditional influencer marketing impractical for smaller stores.

## Understanding Your Shopify Collabs Program

Before recruiting creators, configure your program with clarity and realism.

### Setting Your Commission Structure

Commission rates are the most important decision you'll make. Get this wrong, and you'll either attract low-quality creators or destroy your margins.

**Understanding margins and creator economics:**

Your commission must balance creator incentives with sustainable business economics. Here's how to think about it:

**Example: Product with 60% gross margin**
- Retail price: $100
- Cost of goods sold: $40
- Gross profit: $60 (60% margin)
- Commission at 15%: $15
- Remaining margin: $45 (45%)

After commission, you still have $45 to cover platform fees (2-3%), operations, customer service, and other business expenses. This is survivable. A 30% commission would leave only $30, which may be unsustainable depending on your opex structure.

**Tier your rates by creator size:**

- **Nano-influencers (1K-10K):** 8-12% | Often highly engaged niche audiences
- **Micro-influencers (10K-100K):** 12-18% | Best ROI for most brands
- **Mid-tier (100K-1M):** 15-25% | Established content creators
- **Macro-influencers (1M+):** 20-30% or flat fees | Negotiate based on demonstrated performance

Don't automatically assume bigger creators deserve higher rates. Micro-influencers often deliver better ROI because their audiences are more engaged and niche-aligned.

**Performance-based structures:**

Consider hybrid models that align incentives:

- **Base commission + performance bonus:** 12% base + 3% bonus if sales exceed target
- **Tiered by volume:** 10% for first $5K in sales, 15% for sales $5K-$15K, 20% for sales $15K+
- **Flat fee + commission:** Pay $500 upfront + 8% commission for predictable partnerships
- **Limited-time promotions:** 25% for a single campaign vs. ongoing 12% partnership

Test different structures and measure ROAS by creator type. You'll quickly identify what works for your business.

### Defining Your Brand Guidelines and Expectations

Create a concise brand partner packet that clarifies:

- **Brand voice and values:** What tone should creators use? What values do you stand for?
- **Aesthetic preferences:** Color palette, photography style, specific hashtags to use
- **Disclosure requirements:** "Ad," "#ad," "#partner" placement (legal requirement)
- **Product emphasis:** Which products are priority? What should they avoid?
- **Posting frequency:** Minimum posts expected per month
- **Timeline requirements:** When should partnerships go live?
- **Exclusivity terms:** Can they promote competitors? For how long?
- **Content approval:** Will you require pre-approval of posts?

Be flexible here. Overly rigid guidelines kill authenticity, which is the entire point of creator partnerships. Creators should have autonomy to present your brand in their unique voice.

## Finding the Right Creators for Your Store

Creator discovery is where most influencer programs succeed or fail. You need a system that balances scale with quality.

### Leveraging Shopify Collabs Built-in Discovery

When you activate your Shopify Collabs program, creators in your niche start discovering you organically. The platform shows your program details, commission rates, and store information.

Monitor your Collabs dashboard for incoming creator inquiries. You'll see:

- Creator profiles with follower counts and engagement metrics
- Their audience demographics
- Content categories and prior brand partnerships
- Their earning history on Shopify Collabs

**Criteria for evaluating inbound creators:**

1. **Audience alignment:** Do their followers match your target customer? (Check their audience demographics, not just follower count)
2. **Engagement rate:** What percentage of their audience actually interacts? (2-5% is strong; 0.5% or less is concerning)
3. **Authenticity:** Do they partner with brands genuinely relevant to their audience, or just every brand that pays? (Opportunistic creators drive weak ROI)
4. **Content quality:** Do their posts look professional, well-composed, and on-brand? (Visual quality reflects on your brand)
5. **Audience niche:** Are they creating in a niche adjacent or aligned to your products? (A vegan beauty influencer is better for sustainable cosmetics than a random lifestyle creator)

### Proactive Creator Recruitment

Don't wait only for inbound interest. Proactively identify creators to approach.

**Strategy 1: Hashtag and Trending Sound Research**

On Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, search hashtags relevant to your category:
- #[your product category] + "influencer"
- #[your product category] + "brand partnership"
- Trending sounds + your product category

Identify creators posting authentic content about your product category. Their followers are already interested.

**Strategy 2: Competitor Creator Analysis**

Identify 5-10 competitor stores (or similar-sized brands in your category). Go through their social media. Who are they collaborating with? Research those creators, examine their engagement, and see if they'd be good fit for your products.

This shortcut identifies proven, category-relevant creators faster than random searching.

**Strategy 3: Creator Network Platforms**

Platforms like Creator.co, Aspire, and HypeAuditor index creators by niche, location, and performance metrics. You can filter for your exact target audience and reach out with partnership proposals.

These platforms are worth the investment if you're scaling influencer programs across multiple products or running quarterly campaigns.

**Strategy 4: Community Engagement**

Your best creators often already exist in your community. Monitor:
- User-generated content mentioning your brand
- Repeat customers posting about purchases
- Comments on your posts from engaged accounts
- Hashtags tagged with your brand name

A customer who loves your product and already creates content about it can become a powerful creator partner—often at lower cost because they already have authentic passion.

### Vetting Creators Before Partnerships

Not all creators with impressive follower counts drive ROI. Investigate before offering partnerships.

**Red flags to avoid:**

- **Fake followers:** Use tools like Social Blade or HypeAuditor to check follower growth patterns. Sudden spikes suggest purchased followers.
- **Low engagement:** Posts with hundreds of thousands of followers but dozens of likes/comments. Calculate engagement rate: (Likes + Comments) / Followers = Engagement Rate. Aim for 2% minimum.
- **Inauthentic partnerships:** They promote every brand with zero selectivity. Their audience won't trust recommendations.
- **Niche mismatch:** Beauty influencer promoting fishing equipment signals they'll partner with anything. Narrow your search to creators genuinely interested in your category.
- **Poor content quality:** Blurry photos, ungrammatical captions, chaotic audio suggest they don't take content seriously—or lack the production skills to represent your brand.

**Green flags that indicate quality creators:**

- Consistent posting schedule (2-7 times weekly depending on platform)
- High engagement rates (3-10% on Instagram, 5-15% on TikTok)
- Thoughtful, personal captions that show they know their audience
- Selective brand partnerships (quality over quantity)
- Creator has their own audience across multiple platforms (not Instagram-only, signaling broader reach)

## Building and Managing Creator Relationships

Partnerships that drive the highest ROI aren't transactional—they're relationships. Creators who feel valued and respected promote your products with genuine enthusiasm.

### The Initial Outreach

When reaching out to a creator you've identified, personalize your approach. Generic partnership pitches get ignored.

**What effective outreach looks like:**

"Hi [Creator Name],

I've been following your content for a while, and I really love how you approach [specific aspect of their content]. Your audience seems genuinely engaged with [topic related to your brand].

We just launched [your product/category] at [Your Store], and I think there's a genuine fit between what you create and what our customers are looking for. We're offering [commission rate]% commission through Shopify Collabs.

I'd love to chat about a partnership if it feels right for you. Here's a link to [Your Store]. Let me know if you're interested."

**Why this works:**
- Shows you actually follow them (not a template email)
- Explains the specific fit (not generic)
- Removes friction by making terms clear upfront
- Respects their time (not asking for a call or full application)

### Onboarding New Creators

Once a creator agrees to partner, provide them with everything they need to promote effectively.

**Creator onboarding package should include:**

1. **Product information:** Clear product descriptions, benefits, target customer, why you built it
2. **Brand story:** Who you are, what you stand for, your origin story (creators want to understand the "why")
3. **Visual assets:** Product photos, lifestyle shots, graphics they can use or reference
4. **Talking points:** 5-7 key benefits or use cases to highlight
5. **Shopify Collabs link:** Their unique affiliate link for the platform
6. **Your brand guidelines:** (from earlier in this guide)
7. **FAQ:** Common questions customers ask about your products
8. **First campaign details:** Specific products to promote, posting timeline, key messaging

Provide everything upfront. Creators shouldn't have to chase you for information.

### Communication and Ongoing Relationship Management

The difference between mediocre and exceptional influencer partnerships is ongoing communication.

**Best practices:**

**1. Respect their creative autonomy**

Give direction, not scripts. Instead of: "Post exactly this caption," try: "We'd love to see how you'd use the product in your daily routine." Creators' authenticity is their commodity. Micromanaging kills it.

**2. Respond promptly**

If a creator messages you, respond within 24 hours. They're running a business and may have time-sensitive questions. Responsiveness signals you value the partnership.

**3. Share performance data**

After a creator's post goes live, share how their promotion performed. "Your post drove 2,400 clicks and 87 conversions—your highest-performing content yet!" This data motivates continued effort and shows you're tracking value.

**4. Offer exclusivity and perks**

Your top-performing creators should feel special. Give them first access to new products, exclusive discount codes, or higher commission rates. Small investments in retention prevent recruitment churn.

**5. Monitor brand fit**

If a creator's audience or content evolves away from your brand, or they start promoting problematic brands, it's okay to end partnerships professionally. Not all relationships need to be indefinite.

**6. Provide creative flexibility**

Don't require identical content from all creators. Your micro-influencer on TikTok should create vastly different content than your macro-influencer on Instagram. Each creator has a unique audience and platform dynamics.

### Long-term Partnership Models

Once you identify top-performing creators, move beyond one-off campaigns.

**Tier 1: Long-term ambassadors** (highest performers, 5-10 creators)
- Ongoing 15-20% commission
- Monthly retainer ($500-$2,000 for predictable effort)
- First access to new products
- Quarterly performance bonuses
- Regular communication check-ins

**Tier 2: Regular partners** (reliable performers, 15-30 creators)
- Standard commission rates
- Quarterly collaboration campaigns
- Annual performance reviews
- Performance bonus opportunities

**Tier 3: Casual partnerships** (one-off or seasonal, 50+ creators)
- One-campaign partnerships
- Standard commission structure
- Minimal ongoing communication

This tiered approach lets you invest relationship-building effort where it matters most while still maintaining scale.

## Setting Up Shopify Collabs in Your Admin

Activation is straightforward, but execution requires attention to detail.

### Activation Steps

1. **Navigate to Shopify Admin → Apps → App and sales channels**
2. **Search for "Shopify Collabs"** and add the app
3. **Complete your program setup:**
   - Set commission rates (by product or store-wide)

- Audience demographic overlap with your customers

This data is crucial for measuring ROI and identifying which creators and partnership types drive profitability.

## Measuring Influencer ROI and Profitability

You can't optimize what you don't measure. Influencer marketing should be tracked with the same rigor as any other marketing channel.

### Key Metrics to Track

**1. Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**

ROAS = Revenue from influencer promotion / Total commission paid

A 4:1 ROAS means for every $1 paid in commission, you earned $4 in revenue. Benchmark: 3:1 or higher is generally profitable (depends on your margins).

**Example:**
- Total commission paid to influencers this month: $2,000
- Revenue attributed to those creators: $10,000
- ROAS: 5:1 (Strong performance)

**2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) from Influencer Channel**

CAC = Total commission + overhead / New customers acquired

Compare this to CAC from your other channels (paid ads, organic search, etc.). Influencer marketing should be competitive with or cheaper than paid channels.

**Example:**
- Commission paid: $2,000
- Platform/management overhead: $500
- New customers: 50
- CAC: $50 per customer

**3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) by Influencer Cohort**

This reveals the true profitability picture. A customer acquired via a micro-influencer might have 3x higher repeat purchase rates than customers from a macro-influencer, even if ROAS appears similar.

Track:
- First purchase order value
- Repeat purchase rates at 30, 60, 90 days
- Average lifetime revenue per customer

**Example:**
- Micro-influencer customers: $150 average CLV, 35% repeat rate
- Macro-influencer customers: $120 average CLV, 18% repeat rate

Even though macro-influencer ROAS looked good, micro-influencers drive more valuable customers.

**4. Engagement Quality Metrics**

- Click-through rate (CTR): Percentage of content viewers who click your link
- Conversion rate: Percentage of clicks that result in purchases
- Cart abandonment rate by creator: Some creators drive browsers; others drive buyers

**5. Brand Lift Metrics**

Beyond direct sales, track:
- Branded search volume after creator campaigns (use Google Trends)
- Brand mentions on social media
- Email list growth from influencer traffic
- Website traffic increases during partnership periods

If a creator drives 5,000 website visitors but only 50 conversions, their brand lift value might still justify the partnership.

### Analyzing by Creator Tier

Segment your data by influencer size to identify which tiers drive best ROI:

| Tier | Creators | Total Commission | Revenue | ROAS | Avg CLV | Recommendation |
|------|----------|------------------|---------|------|---------|-----------------|
| Micro (10-100K) | 15 | $3,000 | $24,000 | 8:1 | $210 | Scale up |
| Mid (100K-1M) | 8 | $4,000 | $14,000 | 3.5:1 | $165 | Maintain, test new |
| Macro (1M+) | 2 | $3,000 | $8,000 | 2.7:1 | $140 | Reduce or optimize |

This data reveals that for this brand, micro-influencers drive significantly better returns. Reallocating budget toward micro-influencer recruitment would be the logical next step.

### Avoiding Attribution Errors

Shopify Collabs automatically attributes sales to creator links, but understand the limitations:

**Last-click attribution:** The system credits the creator whose link was clicked last before purchase. If a customer clicks a creator link but comes back later through direct or search, the creator still gets credit.

**This is actually good for creators** (they get credit for the awareness they generated) **but can inflate perceived influencer performance** if you're not careful.

**To refine attribution:**
- Use UTM parameters in addition to affiliate links: `utm_source=collab&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=[creator_name]`
- Track via unique discount codes: Give each creator a unique code to share (5-15% off)
- Compare to control periods: What would sales look like without the creator campaign?

If a creator's link drove 100 attributed sales but only 25 unique discount code uses, the reality is likely somewhere in between.

### Setting Performance Benchmarks

Before launching creator partnerships, establish targets:

- **ROAS goal:** Typically 3:1 minimum; 5:1+ is excellent
- **CAC goal:** Should be 40-60% of typical customer CLV
- **Engagement rate:** Aim for 2%+ on Instagram, 5%+ on TikTok
- **Conversion rate:** 1-3% is typical; varies by niche

Hold creators accountable to these benchmarks after a few campaigns. Underperformers should either improve their approach or be phased out—no matter how large their following.

## Advanced Strategies for Influencer Campaign Success

Once you've mastered basics, these advanced tactics compound results.

### Seasonal and Campaign-Based Partnerships

Rather than ongoing partnerships, coordinate time-limited campaigns around key sales periods:

- **Black Friday/Cyber Monday:** Recruit 20-30 creators for coordinated push
- **New product launches:** Target creators whose audiences match the new product
- **Holiday campaigns:** Seasonal themes (Mother's Day, Back to School, etc.)
- **Inventory clearance:** Leverage creators to move overstocked items

Campaign-based approaches often deliver better ROI than always-on programs because they create urgency and allow for budget concentration.

### Collaboration Campaign Strategy

Rather than each creator posting independently, orchestrate multi-creator campaigns:

**Example campaign: "48-Hour Flash Sale"**
- 15 creators post simultaneously about a limited-time discount
- Creates FOMO and amplifies reach
- Drives urgency for conversions
- Concentrates marketing spend for measurable impact

Coordinated campaigns also allow you to negotiate lower commission rates ("We'll feature you with 10 other creators") while promising higher visibility.

### User-Generated Content Integration

Influencer partnerships extend beyond the creator's initial post. Repurpose their content:

- Feature creator posts on your website
- Repost to your brand Instagram (with permission and credit)
- Use in email marketing
- Feature in retargeting ads
- Incorporate into product pages

This multiplies the value of each creator relationship and gives them additional incentive to create high-quality, on-brand content.

### Building Creator Communities

Your best creators want connection with each other. Create value for your creator network:

- Private Discord or Facebook Group for your creator partners
- Monthly calls sharing performance data and best practices
- Early access to new products (let them discover together)
- Creator feedback on product development
- Recognition programs celebrating top performers

Strong creator communities create network effects—new creators want to join, existing creators feel more loyal, and they cross-pollinate audiences.

---

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

Even well-intentioned programs stumble. Here's what to watch for:

### Payment and Timeliness Issues

Nothing damages creator relationships faster than late or disputed payments.

**Avoid by:**
- Setting clear payment terms upfront (net 30 is standard)
- Automating payouts through Shopify Collabs
- Confirming payment receipt with creators
- Maintaining a calendar of payment deadlines
- Building payment timelines into your cash flow planning

### Insufficient Brand Information

Creators who don't understand your brand, customers, or differentiators will create weak, generic content.

**Avoid by:**
- Creating detailed brand partner packets
- Having a first call with every creator to share your story
- Providing visual brand guidelines
- Offering product samples so creators understand quality
- Keeping a shared doc updated with key messaging

### Poor Fit Partnerships

Chasing creators based purely on follower counts leads to mismatches.

**Avoid by:**
- Prioritizing audience alignment over follower count
- Checking creator's past partnerships for brand fit
- Researching audience demographics
- Testing with small campaigns before major commits
- Walking away from poor-fit creators quickly

### Lack of Contract Clarity

Vague expectations breed disputes.

**Avoid by:**
- Documenting terms (commission rate, posting frequency, timeline, exclusivity)
- Using standardized contract templates
- Getting written acknowledgment of terms
- Being explicit about content approval processes
- Clarifying IP rights (who owns content, how long it can be used)

### Inattention to FTC Compliance

Influencer marketing has FTC requirements around disclosure of sponsored content.

**Avoid by:**
- Educating creators about #ad and #partner disclosure requirements
- Including disclosure instructions in partnership agreements
- Following up to ensure compliance
- Documenting compliance in your records
- Monitoring for failure to disclose and addressing promptly

Non-compliance exposes your brand to FTC action and damaged credibility.

## Shopify Ecosystem Integration

Shopify Collabs works best when integrated with your broader Shopify stack.

### Apps That Complement Shopify Collabs

- **ConvertKit (for email followup):** Capture creator audience emails for retargeting
- **Gorgias (for customer service):** Track customer issues from influencer-sourced customers
- **Klaviyo (for segmentation):** Segment customers by acquisition source (which influencer) for targeted campaigns
- **Attentive (for SMS marketing):** Build SMS list from influencer-sourced customers
- **Analyse (for analytics):** Deep-dive attribution beyond Collabs dashboard

Integrating with email and SMS platforms lets you build relationships with customers acquired from specific creators, boosting their perceived value through repeat purchases.

### Shopify Plus Considerations

Enterprise merchants on Shopify Plus can:
- Custom API integrations with external influencer management platforms
- Advanced commission rules based on product, customer segment, or time
- Custom reporting and dashboard integrations
- White-label creator program
- Advanced fraud detection

If you're running high-volume influencer programs, Shopify Plus offers capabilities standard Shopify doesn't.

## Taking Your Influencer Program to Scale

Once you've proven ROI, scaling becomes a content operations challenge.

### Building a Repeatable Creator Recruitment Process

Document your process:
1. Where you find creators (hashtags, competitor analysis, networks, etc.)
2. Vetting criteria (engagement rate, audience alignment, brand fit)
3. Outreach template and timing
4. Onboarding sequence
5. Performance tracking and evaluation
6. Renewal/expansion criteria

This reproducibility lets you scale without increasing complexity or decreasing quality.

### Hiring a Creator Manager

At $15K-$30K monthly influencer spend, hiring a creator-focused person becomes ROI-positive. They should:
- Own creator recruitment and vetting
- Manage onboarding and communication
- Track performance and provide creator feedback
- Identify upsell opportunities (ambassador programs, exclusive partnerships)
- Maintain creator relationships

One person can effectively manage 50-100 creators depending on complexity.

### Creating Your Creator Brand

Successful influencer programs build reputation in the creator community. Word-of-mouth among creators compounds recruitment.

Build this reputation by:
- Paying on time, every time
- Being professional and respectful
- Providing fair commission rates
- Offering perks and recognition
- Creating opportunities for growth
- Building community among creators

Creators talk to each other. Being known as a good brand to work with dramatically reduces recruitment effort.
