faqs:
  - question: "How long does it take to migrate from Etsy to Shopify?"
    answer: "Migration time depends on your store size and chosen method. Using migration apps, small stores (under 100 products) can migrate in 1-2 hours. Medium stores (100-500 products) typically take 2-4 hours. Large stores (500+ products) may need 4-8 hours. Manual migration without apps takes significantly longer—expect 5-10 minutes per product."
  - question: "Will I lose my Etsy reviews when migrating to Shopify?"
    answer: "Unfortunately, Etsy reviews cannot be directly transferred to Shopify as they belong to Etsy's platform. However, you can screenshot reviews for social proof, use apps like Loox or Judge.me to import reviews as testimonials, or start fresh with Shopify's review apps. Some sellers keep their Etsy shop active initially to maintain review visibility while building Shopify reviews."
  - question: "Can I migrate Etsy product variations to Shopify?"
    answer: "Yes, most migration apps support transferring product variations (size, color, material, etc.) from Etsy to Shopify. LitCommerce, Matrixify, and CedCommerce handle variations particularly well. Note that Shopify has a limit of 3 variant options per product and 100 variants total, which may require restructuring if your Etsy listings exceed these limits."
  - question: "Should I keep my Etsy shop open after migrating to Shopify?"
    answer: "Many sellers maintain both platforms initially. Benefits include: keeping established Etsy traffic and reviews, testing Shopify performance before fully committing, and reaching different customer segments. Apps like LitCommerce and CedCommerce can sync inventory across both platforms. Consider closing Etsy only after Shopify revenue consistently exceeds Etsy revenue."
  - question: "What's the best free option for Etsy to Shopify migration?"
    answer: "For free migration options, Matrixify offers a free plan supporting up to 10 products per import (useful for very small stores). EZ Importer has a free trial. For a completely free approach, you can export Etsy listings as CSV files and manually format them for Shopify's product CSV import template—though this requires significant time and spreadsheet skills."

Moving from Etsy to Shopify is a major decision for any handmade or creative business. While Etsy provides built-in traffic and marketplace trust, Shopify offers complete brand control, better margins, and unlimited growth potential.

The biggest hurdle? Actually migrating your products, images, descriptions, and store data. Doing this manually for hundreds of listings is tedious and error-prone. That's where migration apps come in.

This comprehensive guide compares the best Etsy to Shopify migration apps in 2026, helping you choose the right tool for your store size, budget, and technical comfort level.

## Why Use a Migration App vs. Manual Migration

Before diving into app comparisons, let's address the fundamental question: do you actually need a migration app?

### Manual Migration Process

Without an app, migrating from Etsy to Shopify involves:

1. **Exporting Etsy data** - Download your listings CSV from Etsy
2. **Reformatting the CSV** - Etsy's export format doesn't match Shopify's import template
3. **Downloading images** - Manually save every product image
4. **Re-uploading images** - Add images to each Shopify product
5. **Recreating variations** - Manually set up size/color/material options
6. **Fixing descriptions** - Etsy formatting doesn't always translate cleanly
7. **Setting prices** - Adjust pricing for Shopify's fee structure
8. **Creating collections** - Organize products into Shopify collections

**Time estimate for manual migration:**
- 5-10 products: 1-2 hours
- 50 products: 5-8 hours
- 200 products: 20-30 hours
- 500+ products: 50+ hours

### Migration App Benefits

Using a dedicated migration app provides:

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Time savings** | 80-95% faster than manual migration |
| **Image transfer** | Automatic image download and upload |
| **Variation mapping** | Preserves product variants correctly |
| **Bulk processing** | Migrate hundreds of products in one batch |
| **Error reduction** | Less chance of missing data or typos |
| **Format conversion** | Handles CSV/data format differences |
| **Ongoing sync** | Some apps keep inventory synced across platforms |

**The verdict:** If you have more than 20 products, a migration app almost always saves time and reduces headaches. The cost of most apps is far less than the value of hours spent on manual migration.
