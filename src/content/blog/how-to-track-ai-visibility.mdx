You can't improve what you don't measure. As AI search becomes a critical channel, tracking how your brand appears across AI platforms is essential.

This guide covers practical methods for monitoring your AI visibility, from manual approaches to automated tools.

## Why AI Visibility Tracking Matters

Unlike traditional search where you can check rankings, AI visibility is:
- **Variable**: Same query can yield different responses
- **Conversational**: Context affects recommendations
- **Opaque**: No official "AI rankings" to check

Without tracking, you're flying blind in an increasingly important channel.

## What to Track

### Core Metrics

| Metric | Description | Why It Matters |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Mention Rate** | How often your brand appears for relevant queries | Overall visibility |
| **Position** | Where you appear in the response (first, second, etc.) | Prominence |
| **Sentiment** | How positively you're described | Brand perception |
| **Accuracy** | Whether information about you is correct | Reputation management |
| **Share of Voice** | Your mentions vs. competitors | Competitive position |

### Secondary Metrics

- **Query coverage**: Which queries mention you vs. which don't
- **Feature mentions**: Which product features are highlighted
- **Comparison context**: How you're positioned vs. competitors
- **Consistency**: How similar responses are across queries

## Method 1: Manual Auditing

The simplest approach—regularly query AI platforms and document results.

### How to Do It

**Step 1: Build a Query List**

Create 20-50 queries your target customers might ask:

```
Category Queries:
- "What's the best [category] for [use case]?"
- "Can you recommend a [category]?"
- "What [category] should I use for [need]?"

Comparison Queries:
- "[Your Brand] vs [Competitor]"
- "Is [Your Brand] better than [Competitor]?"
- "Difference between [Your Brand] and [Competitor]"

Problem Queries:
- "How do I solve [problem your product addresses]?"
- "What's the best way to [task your product helps with]?"

Brand Queries:
- "What is [Your Brand]?"
- "Is [Your Brand] good?"
- "Tell me about [Your Brand]"
```

**Step 2: Query Each Platform**

Test on:
- ChatGPT (GPT-4)
- Claude
- Perplexity
- Google Gemini
- Microsoft Copilot

**Step 3: Document Results**

For each query, record:
- Date and time
- Platform and model version
- Full response text
- Whether you were mentioned
- Position in response
- Sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)
- Accuracy of information
- Competitors mentioned

**Step 4: Track Over Time**

Repeat monthly to track changes.

### Manual Audit Template

```markdown
## AI Visibility Audit - [Month Year]

### Query: "What's the best CRM for small businesses?"

**ChatGPT Response:**
[Paste full response]

**Analysis:**
- Mentioned: Yes/No
- Position: 1st/2nd/3rd/Not mentioned
- Sentiment: Positive/Neutral/Negative
- Accuracy: Correct/Minor errors/Major errors
- Competitors mentioned: [List]

**Notes:**
[Any observations]
```

### Pros and Cons of Manual Tracking

**Pros:**
- No cost
- Full context of responses
- Flexibility in queries

**Cons:**
- Time-consuming
- Results vary (not statistically significant)
- Hard to scale

## Method 2: Systematic Sampling

For more reliable data, use systematic sampling with multiple queries.

### The Approach

1. **Query each test prompt 5-10 times** across different sessions
2. **Calculate mention rate** as percentage of queries where you appear
3. **Use statistical significance** to track real changes vs. noise

### Example Tracking Sheet

| Query | Attempts | Mentions | Rate | Avg Position |
|-------|----------|----------|------|--------------|
| "Best CRM for startups" | 10 | 7 | 70% | 2.1 |
| "CRM recommendations" | 10 | 6 | 60% | 2.8 |
| "What CRM should I use" | 10 | 8 | 80% | 1.5 |

### Statistical Considerations

With AI variability, small changes may be noise. Look for:
- Changes >15-20% in mention rate
- Consistent changes across multiple queries
- Changes that persist over multiple audits

## Method 3: API-Based Monitoring

For scale, use AI platform APIs to automate tracking.

### Basic Setup

```python
# Conceptual example - adapt to your needs
import openai
from datetime import datetime

queries = [
    "What's the best CRM for small businesses?",
    "Can you recommend a CRM?",
    # ... more queries
]

def check_visibility(query, brand_name):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": query}]
    )

    text = response.choices[0].message.content
    mentioned = brand_name.lower() in text.lower()

    return {
        "query": query,
        "mentioned": mentioned,
        "response": text,
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }

# Run daily/weekly and store results
```

### What to Build

1. **Query runner**: Systematically test queries across platforms
2. **Response parser**: Extract mentions, position, sentiment
3. **Data storage**: Store results for trend analysis
4. **Alerting**: Notify on significant changes

### Considerations

- **Cost**: API calls have costs—budget accordingly
- **Rate limits**: Respect platform rate limits
- **Terms of service**: Ensure compliance with platform ToS

## Method 4: Third-Party Tools

Several tools now offer AI visibility tracking:

### Tool Categories

**AI Monitoring Platforms:**
- Track mentions across multiple AI platforms
- Provide dashboards and alerts
- Offer competitive benchmarking

**Brand Monitoring Tools (with AI features):**
- Traditional brand monitoring adding AI tracking
- May have broader coverage but less depth

**SEO Platforms (adding AI):**
- SEO tools incorporating AI visibility metrics
- Useful for combined traditional + AI search view

### What to Look For

- Coverage of major AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity)
- Query customization for your industry
- Historical data and trend analysis
- Competitive tracking capabilities
- Sentiment analysis
- Accuracy checking

## Method 5: Proxy Metrics

When direct tracking is difficult, use proxy metrics that correlate with AI visibility:

### Brand Search Volume

If AI mentions your brand, some users will search for it directly:
- Track branded search volume in Google Search Console
- Monitor trends over time
- Compare to AI optimization efforts

### Direct Traffic

Brand awareness from AI can drive direct site visits:
- Monitor direct traffic in analytics
- Track new vs. returning visitor ratios
- Analyze traffic patterns around AI events

### Survey Data

Ask customers how they found you:
- Include "AI assistant recommendation" as an option
- Track percentage over time
- Correlate with visibility efforts

### Social Listening

AI recommendations can generate social discussion:
- Monitor brand mentions on social platforms
- Track "ChatGPT told me about [brand]" style mentions
- Analyze sentiment trends

## Setting Up Your Tracking System

### Starter Setup (Low Budget)

1. **Manual monthly audit** using the template above
2. **Brand search tracking** via Google Search Console
3. **Survey question** added to post-purchase flows
4. **Spreadsheet tracking** of results over time

### Intermediate Setup (Medium Budget)

1. **Systematic sampling** with 5-10 query attempts
2. **Basic API monitoring** for automated tracking
3. **Third-party tool** for one platform
4. **Dashboard** for visualization

### Advanced Setup (Higher Budget)

1. **Full API monitoring** across all platforms
2. **Comprehensive third-party tool** with competitive tracking
3. **Custom alerting** for significant changes
4. **Integration** with other marketing dashboards

## Reporting AI Visibility
