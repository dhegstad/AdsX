  - question: "What is the best commission structure for a Shopify affiliate program?"
    answer: "The best commission structure depends on your product margins and industry. Typically, e-commerce stores offer 5-15% commission on successful sales. Physical products often use 5-10%, while digital products and SaaS can sustain 15-30%. Start with 10% as a baseline and adjust based on affiliate performance and your profitability analysis."
  - question: "How do I recruit affiliates for my Shopify store?"
    answer: "Recruit affiliates through multiple channels: reach out to your existing customer base, partner with complementary brands, contact micro-influencers in your niche, post on affiliate networks like ShareASale and Impact, and create a compelling affiliate program page. Personalized outreach typically converts better than cold recruitment."
  - question: "Which affiliate apps are best for Shopify in 2026?"
    answer: "The top three affiliate apps for Shopify are Refersion (easiest to use, built-in tools), UpPromote (comprehensive features, strong support), and GoAffPro (flexible, white-label options). Choose based on your budget, desired features, and technical requirements. Many stores use multiple apps for different audience segments."
  - question: "How do I track affiliate sales and prevent fraud?"
    answer: "Use dedicated affiliate tracking software that provides 30-90 day cookies, unique affiliate codes, and fraud detection. Most reputable apps like Refersion and UpPromote include fraud prevention built-in. Monitor for unusual patterns like bulk same-IP orders or unusually high returns, which may indicate affiliate fraud."
  - question: "When should I pay my affiliates?"
    answer: "Most Shopify affiliate programs use 30-day payment cycles starting after the purchase, allowing time to verify the sale and handle returns. Net-30 payment terms are standard in the industry. Some premium affiliate networks offer bi-weekly or weekly payouts for top performers to encourage higher volume."

Affiliate marketing is one of the most cost-effective ways to grow your Shopify store. Rather than paying upfront for ads, you only pay commissions when someone actually makes a purchase through an affiliate's link.

In 2026, successful e-commerce brands are leveraging affiliate programs to 2-3x their sales without the overhead of traditional marketing. Whether you're a new Shopify store or an established brand, affiliate marketing can unlock significant growth.

This comprehensive guide walks you through everything you need to launch, manage, and scale a profitable affiliate program for your Shopify store.

## Why Affiliate Marketing Is Perfect for Shopify Stores

### The Economics Are Unbeatable

Traditional advertising channels require upfront investment before you see any returns. Affiliate marketing flips this model: you only pay when someone makes a purchase.

**The Financial Impact:**
- **Lower customer acquisition costs**: You pay on performance, not impressions
- **Reduced marketing risk**: Budget scales directly with revenue
- **Higher ROI than paid ads**: Well-managed affiliate programs often deliver 3:1 to 5:1 ROI
- **Predictable cost structure**: Commissions are fixed percentages, making forecasting easier

A typical Shopify store running both paid ads and affiliate programs sees a 40% lower CAC through affiliates compared to Google Shopping ads.

### Access to New Audiences

Your own marketing reaches your existing networks. Affiliates open doors to completely new audiences:

- **Complementary brands** expose you to their customer bases
- **Micro-influencers** bring engaged niche audiences
- **Bloggers and content creators** introduce you through trusted editorial content
- **Email list owners** tap into established subscriber bases
- **Deal sites** reach bargain hunters actively looking for discounts

If you sell fitness gear, an affiliate partnership with nutrition blogs, gym influencers, and wellness podcasters instantly reaches fitness-minded customers you couldn't target affordably through ads.

### Lower Barrier to Partnership

Running an affiliate program is cheaper than managing influencer partnerships or sponsorships. For many affiliates, a commission structure is more attractive than fixed fees:

- **Micro-influencers** appreciate the ongoing earning potential
- **Content creators** can participate without negotiating contracts
- **Email marketers** love promoting products that truly convert
- **Deal sites** benefit from the instant monetization

You'll attract more partners at a lower cost compared to traditional sponsorships.

### Performance-Based Growth

Unlike advertising where you speculate on results, affiliate marketing delivers measurable outcomes:

- Every sale is tracked to a specific affiliate
- You know exactly which partners drive the most revenue
- Scaling becomes scientific: reward top performers and optimize underperformers
- Attribution is clear, making ROI calculations straightforward

## Benefits of Affiliate Marketing for E-commerce

### 1. Predictable, Scalable Revenue

Once your affiliate program is established, you have a steady stream of incoming orders from partners who are financially motivated to promote your products.

**Example**: A Shopify store selling specialty coffee started with 5 affiliates. Within 6 months, they had 150 active affiliates generating 35% of total revenue.

### 2. Social Proof at Scale

When multiple trusted voices recommend your product, buyer confidence increases dramatically. Customers are 71% more likely to make a purchase based on word-of-mouth recommendations compared to traditional ads.

Your affiliates become extensions of your sales force, each bringing credibility to your brand.

### 3. Content You Don't Have to Create

Affiliates create product reviews, comparisons, tutorials, and recommendations featuring your products. This content:

- Ranks in Google search results for product-related queries
- Builds backlinks to your site, improving SEO
- Provides fresh, authentic perspectives on your products
- Drives traffic from multiple sources

### 4. Competitive Advantage

Most small and mid-sized Shopify stores don't have affiliate programs. By establishing one early, you capture an underserved distribution channel while competitors are still relying solely on paid ads.

### 5. Reduced Dependency on Paid Ads

Over-reliance on any single customer acquisition channel is risky. Affiliate marketing diversifies your traffic and revenue sources:

- Less exposure to ad platform algorithm changes
- Protection against rising CPC costs
- More resilient business model

## Setting Up Your Commission Structure

Your commission structure is the foundation of your affiliate program's success. Get it wrong and affiliates won't promote, or you'll destroy your margins.

### Understanding Commission Types

**Percentage Commission (Most Common)**
- Affiliates earn a percentage of each sale (e.g., 10% of order value)
- Easy to understand and manage
- Scales naturally with product price increases
- Example: $100 sale with 10% = $10 commission

**Fixed Commission Per Sale**
- Flat payout per conversion regardless of order value
- Example: $5 per order
- Good for testing new affiliates
- Works well for products with consistent price points

**Tiered Commissions**
- Higher percentages as affiliates hit performance milestones
- Example: 5% for first 10 sales, 10% after that, 15% after 50 sales/month
- Incentivizes higher volume
- Common with professional affiliate programs

**Hybrid Structures**
- Combine multiple approaches for different affiliate tiers
- Example: 10% base for all affiliates, plus 5% bonus for affiliates hitting monthly targets
- Most sophisticated approach
- Requires more management

### Recommended Commission Rates by Product Type

| Product Category | Typical Range | Sweet Spot |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Physical Products (Low Margin)** | 3-8% | 5% |
| **Physical Products (High Margin)** | 8-15% | 10% |
| **Digital Products** | 10-30% | 20% |
| **SaaS/Subscriptions** | 15-30% | 25% |
| **High Ticket Items ($500+)** | 5-10% | 8% |
| **Commodities/Low Margin** | 2-5% | 3% |

### How to Choose Your Rate

Start by analyzing your economics:

**1. Calculate Your Product Margin**
- If your product costs $50 to acquire and you sell it for $100, your margin is $50
- If you run a 10% affiliate program, that's $10 commission

**2. Factor in Other Marketing Costs**
- What's your average CAC from paid ads?
- What's your average order value?
- What's your repeat purchase rate?

**3. Benchmark Against Competitors**
- Research what other stores in your vertical offer
- Check affiliate networks like ShareASale to see typical rates

**4. Start Conservative, Test Aggressively**
- Begin with 10% as a baseline
- A/B test different rates with different affiliate tiers
- Increase rates by 2-3% for top performers as they hit volume targets

**Recommended Launch Strategy**:

- **Month 1**: 10% for all affiliates (attractive but not margin-crushing)
- **Month 2-3**: Analyze which affiliates drive the most volume
- **Month 4+**: Implement tiered structure rewarding top performers with 15%+

This approach attracts quality affiliates while protecting your margins.

### Compensation Beyond Commission

Money isn't the only incentive:

- **Exclusive discounts** on your products (especially valuable for influencers)
- **Priority payment terms** for top performers (weekly instead of monthly)
- **Affiliate bonuses** for hitting volume targets ($500 bonus for 100 sales/month)
- **Co-marketing opportunities** (feature their content on your channels)
- **Free products** for content creation and reviews

Top affiliate programs use multiple incentives to build loyalty and increase promotion effort.

## Recruiting and Managing Affiliates

A great commission structure means nothing if you don't have affiliates to promote. Strategic recruitment is where most programs succeed or fail.

### Where to Find Quality Affiliates

### 1. Your Existing Customers

**Why they're ideal**: They've already bought from you, so they genuinely believe in your product.

**Recruitment tactics:**
- Create a specific "Affiliate Program" page and email it to past customers
- Offer exclusive commission rates to loyal repeat customers (12-15% instead of 10%)
- Follow up personally with your biggest customers
- Create an affiliate onboarding email sequence that explains the program and provides first promotional assets

**Example email approach**:
> Subject: Earn $200-500/month promoting [your product]
>
> Hi [Customer Name],
>
> We noticed you've ordered [product] three times in the past year. You clearly love it.
>
> How would you like to earn commissions every time someone buys through your unique affiliate link? As one of our best customers, we're offering you 15% commission—higher than our standard 10% rate.
>
> Most of our top-performing affiliates earn $200-500/month in commissions with just 20-30 referrals. Click below to join our affiliate program today.
>
> [Affiliate Program Link]

This approach has 15-25% conversion rates because they already trust your product.

### 2. Complementary Brands

**Why they're valuable**: Their audiences overlap with yours, but you're not direct competitors.

**Example partnerships**:
- Selling fitness gear? Partner with nutrition brands, yoga platforms, training apps
- Selling productivity software? Partner with other SaaS tools for entrepreneurs
- Selling pet supplies? Partner with veterinary clinics, pet training, pet food brands

**Recruitment approach**:
- Research 20-30 complementary brands in your space
- Create a one-page "affiliate partnership proposal" (not a pitch—a collaboration proposal)
- Reach out to their founder or marketing head on LinkedIn
- Offer them a slightly higher commission (12-15%) in exchange for regular promotion

**Sample outreach**:
> Hi [Name],
>
> I love what you're doing with [their brand]. Your audience is full of people who care about [shared value], just like our customers.
>
> I think we could help each other. We have a new affiliate program that's converting well—our partners are earning $500-1500/month with just casual promotion.
>
> Would you be open to exploring a partnership? If so, I can set you up immediately with a 15% commission rate and all the promotional assets you need.
>
> Let me know,
> [Your name]

Success rate: 30-40% of outreach typically converts to active affiliates.

### 3. Micro-Influencers in Your Niche

**Why they matter**: Micro-influencers (10K-100K followers) often have higher engagement rates than mega-influencers and are more affordable.

**Recruitment tactics:**
- Use tools like HypeAudience, Klear, or Creator.co to find relevant influencers
- Look for creators whose audience matches your customer profile
- Personalize outreach mentioning specific content they've created
- Offer higher commissions (15-25%) to attract influencer participation

**Sample outreach to micro-influencers**:
> Hi [Influencer Name],
>
> I've been following your content about [topic] for a while, and I'm impressed with how genuinely you connect with your audience.
>
> We just launched a product [brief description] that I think your followers would love based on the content you create. Would you be interested in promoting it to your audience? You'd earn 20% commission on every sale, plus we can send you a free product to try out first.
>
> Let me know if you're interested,
> [Your name]

Success rate: 25-35% of meaningful outreach typically converts.

### 4. Bloggers and Content Creators

**Why they're valuable**: Blog posts rank in Google for years and drive consistent affiliate traffic.

**How to find them**:
- Search "[your industry] + blog" or "[your niche] + guide"
- Look at who's already creating content about your product category
- Check if they have an "affiliate" or "partnerships" page (easier to recruit)

**Recruitment approach**:
- Read 2-3 of their articles to understand their perspective
- Reach out explaining why your product fits their audience
- Offer to provide exclusive discount code for their audience (generates goodwill)
- Make joining your affiliate program extremely easy

### 5. Email List Owners and Newsletter Creators

**Why they convert**: Email audiences are highly engaged and typically make purchases.

**How to reach them**:
- Look for newsletters in your industry (check Substack, Beehiiv directories)
- Find newsletter sponsorship rates
- Calculate: If they charge $X for sponsorship, offer them [that value] in potential commissions

**Example email**:
> Hi [Newsletter Creator],
>
> I've been reading [their newsletter] for the past three months. You've built something special with your audience.
>
> We have a product our customers love, and I think your audience would too. Rather than a sponsorship fee, would you be interested in promoting it to your list and earning commission on each sale? Top-performing newsletter partners earn $1000-5000/month with us.
>
> Let me know if you'd like to try it,
> [Your name]

### 6. Affiliate Networks

**Popular platforms**:
- ShareASale (largest affiliate network)
- CJ Affiliate
- Impact (formerly Conversive)
- Awin (strong international presence)

**How it works**:
- List your program on the network for a small fee
- Active affiliates can discover your program
- Network handles some payment and tracking infrastructure

**Pros**: Access to existing affiliate pool
**Cons**: Network takes a cut, less personal control

**Best use**: As one channel among several, not your only recruitment strategy

## Recruitment Best Practices

### Create a Dedicated Affiliate Program Page

Your affiliate page should answer:
- What's the commission rate?
- How does tracking work?
- What promotional assets are provided?
- How are commissions paid?
- Why should someone promote your product?

**Example structure**:

> **Join Our Affiliate Program**
>
> Earn 10-15% commission every time someone buys through your unique link.
>
> ### Why Promote Us?
> - [List 3-5 benefits]
> - Best-in-class products
> - Fast 30-day commissions
> - Dedicated affiliate support
>
> ### Promotional Assets We Provide
> - Product images and videos
> - Sample social media posts
> - Email copy templates
> - Banner ads
>
> [Apply Now Button]

### Provide Quality Promotional Assets

The easier you make it for affiliates to promote, the more they'll promote.

**Essential assets to provide**:
- 3-5 product photos (high-resolution)
- 10-20 sample social media posts they can copy-paste
- 3-5 email templates they can send to their list
- Product comparison graphics
- Pre-written reviews or product benefits

The barrier to getting started should be near zero.

### Launch with 5-10 Quality Affiliates, Not 100 Random Ones

You'll do much better with 5 great affiliates generating consistent traffic than 50 affiliates who promote sporadically.

Focus your early recruitment on:
- Your best customers
- Complementary brands
- High-quality content creators

Quality beats volume, especially early on.

### Provide Ongoing Support

Top affiliate programs treat affiliates like partners, not distant marketers:

- Monthly affiliate newsletters with promotional ideas
- Quarterly bonus structure changes announced in advance
- Dedicated email support (not auto-responses)
- Monthly calls with top performers discussing strategy

This support turns casual affiliates into committed promoters.

---

## Advanced Affiliate Management Strategies

### Creating Affiliate Tiers

As your program grows, implement tiers that reward performance:

**Bronze Tier** (1-10 sales/month)
- 10% commission
- Access to basic promotional assets
- Monthly email newsletter

**Silver Tier** (11-50 sales/month)
- 12% commission
- Priority email support
- Exclusive promotional assets
- Monthly affiliate call

**Gold Tier** (50+ sales/month)
- 15% commission
- Direct contact with you or affiliate manager
- Co-marketing opportunities
- Access to new products before launch

This structure:
- Incentivizes higher volume
- Creates status that drives performance
- Makes top performers feel valued
- Motivates growth

### Seasonal Promotional Campaigns

Run special affiliate campaigns around key selling periods:

**Black Friday/Cyber Monday**
- Increase commissions 5-10% for the period
- Create dedicated promotional materials
- Run daily affiliate email updates

**Back-to-School (for relevant products)**
- 15% commission boost
- Provide student-focused messaging

**Product Launches**
- 20% commission for the first month
- Exclusive early access for top affiliates

### Preventing Affiliate Fraud

Affiliate fraud costs e-commerce companies millions. Protect yourself:

**Common fraud types:**
- Offering excessive discounts to artificially inflate volume
- Cookie stuffing (placing tracking links on high-traffic sites to capture unrelated sales)
- Buying traffic from low-quality sources
- Creating fake sales

**Prevention measures:**
1. Monitor for unusual patterns:
   - Sudden traffic spikes from new affiliates
   - Orders from the same IP address with different names
   - High return rates on affiliate sales
   - Orders that don't match normal customer behavior

2. Set clear program rules:
   - No misleading marketing claims
   - No email list harvesting
   - No trademark bidding (usually)
   - Explicit requirements for transparent "affiliate link" disclosures

3. Use software fraud detection:
   - Most affiliate apps (Refersion, UpPromote, GoAffPro) include built-in detection
   - Monitor for velocity patterns
   - Watch for unusual conversion rates

4. Have a review process:
   - Manually review affiliates hitting 50+ sales/month
   - Check their promotion methods
   - Don't be afraid to remove bad actors

## Tracking and Attribution: Getting the Details Right

Accurate tracking is non-negotiable. You can't manage what you can't measure.

### How Affiliate Tracking Works

Each affiliate gets a unique tracking link that looks like:
`https://yourstore.com/?affiliate=johnsmith`

or

`https://yourstore.com/?ref=johnsmith`

When someone clicks this link, a cookie is placed on their browser (typically valid for 30-90 days). If they buy within that window, the sale is attributed to the affiliate.

### Choosing Your Cookie Duration

| Duration | Best For | Considerations |
|----------|----------|---|
| **7 days** | Impulse purchases, fast-moving products | Short window, loses some conversions |
| **30 days** | Standard e-commerce | Balances accuracy with capturing most sales |
| **60 days** | High consideration purchases | Better captures considered decisions |
| **90 days** | B2B or complex products | May attribute sales the affiliate didn't influence |

**Recommendation**: Start with 30 days for most products. Adjust to 60 days if customers typically take 2-4 weeks to decide.

### Tracking Link Best Practices

**1. Use Clear, Memorable Affiliate IDs**
Instead of random codes, use identifiable usernames:
- ❌ `?affiliate=a7k3jXz2m`
- ✅ `?affiliate=sarah_fitness_blog`

Affiliates want to track their own performance easily and recognize themselves.

**2. Provide Multiple Link Formats**
- Tracking links
- QR codes
- Coupon codes (e.g., "SARAH10")
- Short links (using bit.ly or rebrandly)

Different affiliates prefer different formats. Email marketers love coupon codes. Social media creators prefer QR codes.

**3. Create Landing Page Variations**
Provide different landing page links for different audiences:
- `/affiliates/fitness` for fitness influencers
- `/affiliates/budget` for deal/coupon sites
- `/affiliates/demo` for SaaS trial signups

This improves conversion because messaging matches the audience.

### Attribution Models

**Last-Click Attribution** (Most Common)
- The last affiliate click before purchase gets 100% credit
- Simple but can mislead if multiple touchpoints exist

**Multi-Touch Attribution** (More Accurate)
- Credit is distributed among multiple touchpoints
- Example: 40% first touch, 60% last touch
- More complex but reveals true impact

**Example**:
Customer journey:
1. Sees Instagram post from Influencer A (affiliate link, doesn't click)
2. Searches for your product on Google
3. Finds Influencer B's blog review (clicks affiliate link)
4. Buys

- Last-click gives 100% to Influencer B
- Multi-touch might credit both influencers

**Recommendation**: Start with last-click for simplicity. Migrate to multi-touch if you have the sophistication to manage it.

### Preventing Double Attribution

Make sure sales can't be credited to multiple affiliates:

- Only the first affiliate click should count in a session
- Clear cookies when an affiliate unlinks
- Have a dispute resolution process if an affiliate feels credited incorrectly

---

## Payout Structures and Payment Processing

How and when you pay affiliates dramatically affects program loyalty.

### Standard Payout Timelines

| Timeline | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Weekly** | Affiliates love it, encourages promotion | Requires more administration |
| **Bi-weekly** | Good balance | Still more work than monthly |
| **Monthly (30 days)** | Industry standard, allows for return windows | Slower for cash flow-focused affiliates |
| **Monthly (60 days)** | More buffer for returns and chargebacks | Affiliates may move to competitors |

**Best practice**: Net-30 (commissions earned in January paid in February) with monthly payout. Offer bi-weekly payouts to top 10% of affiliates as a loyalty bonus.

### Setting a Minimum Payout Threshold

Most programs require a minimum balance before paying out (typically $25-50) to avoid payment processing fees.

- $25 minimum for PayPal/ACH transfers
- $100 minimum for check or other methods
- No minimum if you have high volume

### Payment Methods

Offer multiple options:
1. **PayPal** (easiest, most affiliates have accounts)
2. **Direct Deposit/ACH** (free for you, reliable)
3. **Check** (for international or those without digital banking)
4. **Platform Wallet** (keep funds in an account for future payments)

PayPal is standard but charge back fees can be high. Many serious programs move top affiliates to direct deposit after they prove trustworthy.

### Handling Payment Disputes and Chargebacks

Set clear policy:

- If a customer disputes a charge within 30 days, the affiliate doesn't get paid
- If a customer returns the product, the affiliate commission is reversed
- Provide clear earning statements showing which sales are still "pending"

Transparency prevents bitter disputes.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Setting Commission Too Low

Starting at 5% and wondering why no one promotes you. Your competitors offering 15% are getting all the attention.

**Solution**: Start at 10% minimum for physical products, 20% for digital. You can always lower it later; raising it won't attract the affiliates who've already moved on.

### 2. Poor Tracking and Attribution

Affiliates can't trust your numbers if they can't verify them. This is the #1 cause of affiliate program failure.

**Solution**: Use reputable software with transparent dashboards. Allow affiliates to see real-time conversion data. Respond quickly to attribution disputes.

### 3. No Support or Communication

Leaving affiliates to figure things out on their own. They'll just promote a competitor's program instead.

**Solution**: Set up affiliate onboarding. Send monthly newsletters. Have someone respond to affiliate emails within 24 hours. Schedule quarterly calls with top performers.

### 4. Focusing on Quantity Over Quality

Signing up 500 affiliates who never promote. One person promoting consistently beats 100 people promoting once.

**Solution**: Actively recruit quality affiliates. Monitor promotion activity. Remove inactive affiliates after 90 days. Focus on converting casual promoters to active ones.

### 5. Launching Without Promotional Assets

Telling affiliates "Go promote us" without providing images, copy, or email templates. Most won't know how to start.

**Solution**: Provide a complete asset library before launch. Include sample posts, images, product descriptions, and email templates.

### 6. Not Monitoring for Fraud

Letting bad actors destroy your margins through coupon abuse or fake sales.

**Solution**: Monitor for unusual patterns. Have clear program guidelines. Review suspicious activity. Remove bad actors quickly.

### 7. Ignoring Your Best Affiliates

Treating all affiliates equally. Your top 20% generate 80% of revenue; they deserve special attention.

**Solution**: Implement tiering. Give top performers higher commissions, bonuses, and personal attention. Make them feel valued.

## Compliance and Legal Considerations

### Affiliate Disclosure Requirements

The FTC requires affiliates to clearly disclose they're earning commission on sales. This is not optional.

**FTC Affiliate Endorsement Guides** require:
- Clear disclosure that someone is being paid
- Disclosure must be prominent (not hidden in tiny text)
- Plain language (not "affiliate link" in 8pt font)

**Common disclosure formats:**
- "I earn commission from purchases made through this link"
- "[Hashtag]ad" on Instagram (if paid to promote)
- "Affiliate link—I earn commission at no extra cost to you"

In your program guidelines, require all affiliates to include proper disclosures. Make sample disclosures available.

### Tax Considerations

Affiliates earning commissions are essentially independent contractors. In the US:

- You must collect tax information (at least email)
- Report annual payments $20+ using Form 1099 (check IRS rules for your state)
- Keep records of affiliate payments

Most affiliate software automates this. Confirm your software handles tax reporting.

### Terms of Service and Program Agreement

Create simple but clear program terms that cover:
- Commission structure and payment terms
- What behavior is prohibited (fraudulent activity, trademark bidding, etc.)
- Dispute resolution process
- Program termination conditions
- Data privacy (you collect their info)

**Don't require**:
- Exclusive promotion (they can promote competitors)
- Minimum sales quotas (hard to enforce)
- Content approval (brands have less control over affiliate content)

Keep it simple and fair. Overly restrictive terms keep away good affiliates.

## Integration with Your Broader Marketing

Affiliate marketing shouldn't exist in isolation. It works best as part of a coordinated strategy.

### Shopify Affiliate Program + Paid Ads

**Effective combination:**
- Run Google/Facebook ads to build awareness
- Affiliates capitalize on the awareness by promoting to their audiences
- Lower CAC on affiliate channel because demand is already established

**Example**: Run a $10K Google Ads campaign in month 1. Month 2-3, activate affiliate program. Affiliates drive incremental sales at much lower cost because your products are already top-of-mind.

### Affiliate Program + Content Marketing

Blog content and affiliate content work synergistically:

- Your blog ranks for informational keywords
- Affiliate blogs rank for commercial keywords ("best X", "X review")
- Together they cover the full customer journey

### Affiliate Program + Email Marketing

Your email list is valuable to affiliates:

- Newsletter creators want to join your program
- You can feature affiliates' content in your newsletter
- Collaborations between you and affiliates benefit both
