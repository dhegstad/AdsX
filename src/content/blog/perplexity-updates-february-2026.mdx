## The Big News: Perplexity Abandons Advertising

In the most significant announcement this month, Perplexity AI completely abandoned its advertising strategy.

### What Happened

Perplexity removed all sponsored answers from its platform and confirmed it has no plans to bring advertising back. This reverses the ad testing program that began in 2024, where brands could purchase sponsored placements in AI-generated responses.

### Why They Did It

The decision came down to trust. As a Perplexity executive explained to the Financial Times: "The challenge with ads is that a user would just start doubting everything."

The company believes sponsored placements, even clearly labeled ones, risk undermining the trust on which its AI answer engine depends. Users need to believe they're getting the best possible answer, not one influenced by advertising dollars.

### What This Means for Brands

**The good news:** Perplexity remains committed to organic visibility. Your brand can still appear in answers through high-quality content, proper structured data, and strategic source optimization.

**The challenge:** Without advertising, you can't pay for guaranteed placement. You need to earn visibility through:
- Being cited as a credible source
- Creating content that answers questions comprehensively
- Building brand authority in your category
- Optimizing for AI-friendly content formats

**The competitive shift:** While ChatGPT introduced advertising in February 2026 for Free and Go tier users, Perplexity is moving in the opposite direction. This creates distinct positioning: ChatGPT as the ad-supported consumer platform, Perplexity as the subscription-based trusted research tool.

## New AI Models and Features

Perplexity rolled out substantial model upgrades this month that dramatically improve answer quality.

### Opus 4.6 Powers Deep Research

On February 13, 2026, Perplexity upgraded its Deep Research feature to run on Anthropic's Opus 4.6 model. This significantly improves performance on research-intensive tasks requiring high accuracy.

Deep Research generates comprehensive reports by:
- Conducting multi-step research across sources
- Synthesizing information from 100+ citations
- Creating structured analysis with proper attribution
- Maintaining context across complex topics

The Opus 4.6 upgrade is available now for Max users and gradually rolling out to Pro users.

### GPT-5.2 and Seedream 4.5 Added

Perplexity added two major new models for Pro and Max subscribers:

**GPT-5.2** excels at:
- Coding tasks (top performance on SWE-Bench Pro)
- Multi-step reasoning problems
- Technical documentation generation
- Complex problem decomposition

**Seedream 4.5** from Bytedance delivers:
- Cinematic-quality image generation
- Better photorealism than previous models
- Improved prompt adherence
- Faster generation times

### Kimi K2.5 Reasoning Model

Perplexity also added Kimi K2.5, a state-of-the-art open source reasoning model from Moonshot AI. Notably, Perplexity hosts this on its own inference stack in the US, demonstrating its commitment to infrastructure independence.

### Model Council Gets Memory Integration

Model Council, available on web only for Perplexity Max subscribers, now integrates personal memories for each model. This feature runs three frontier models simultaneously, compares outputs, and synthesizes more accurate, higher-confidence answers.

The memory integration means Model Council now:
- Recalls your preferences across all three models
- Tailors responses based on your history
- Provides personalized analysis from multiple AI perspectives
- Delivers sharper, more contextual multi-model insights

## Enhanced Memory System

Perplexity dramatically improved how it remembers and recalls user context.

### 95% Recall Accuracy

The new memory system recalls relevant information in 95% of cases, up from 77%. This means Perplexity is far more likely to remember:
- Your product preferences
- Industry context about your business
- Previous research topics
- Stated constraints and requirements

### Reduced Memory Clutter

While recall improved, Perplexity also makes half as many memories. The system is more selective about what to remember, reducing clutter and focusing on genuinely useful context.

This creates a better experience where Perplexity remembers what matters without getting bogged down in irrelevant details.

### Available for Pro and Max Users

The enhanced memory system has rolled out to both Pro ($20/month) and Max ($200/month) subscribers.

## Perplexity Shopping Enhancements

Perplexity continues expanding its shopping capabilities, creating a new channel for product discovery.

### How Perplexity Shopping Works

Unlike traditional product search that returns generic results, Perplexity Shopping uses AI to understand natural language questions and provide curated, context-rich recommendations.

**Example queries:**
- "Best standing desk for small apartment under $500"
- "Sustainable running shoes for overpronation"
- "Laptop for video editing with good battery life"

Perplexity maintains context throughout the conversation, so you can ask follow-ups like "What about in black?" or "Show me cheaper options" without repeating the original query.

### Buy with Pro

Pro users in the US can complete purchases directly through Perplexity with "Buy with Pro," which offers:
- Seamless checkout without leaving the platform
- Free shipping on all Buy with Pro orders
- Integration with select merchants
- PayPal-powered payment processing

This transforms Perplexity from a research tool into a complete shopping destination.

### Snap to Shop

"Snap to Shop" is a visual search feature that lets you photograph items and instantly find relevant products. You don't need to know product names or descriptions - just take a photo.

This is particularly powerful for:
- Finding alternatives to out-of-stock items
- Identifying products from photos or videos
- Discovering similar styles across brands
- Price comparison for visual items

### Personalization and Memory

Perplexity Shopping remembers your preferences and patterns. Ask about a desk lamp, and it finds options matching your aesthetic preferences rather than what advertisers want to push.

This personalization improves over time as Perplexity learns:
- Your style preferences
- Budget ranges you typically consider
- Features you prioritize
- Brands you prefer or avoid

### Merchant Integration

Perplexity partners with Shopify to provide access to recent and relevant product information across Shopify-powered businesses globally that sell and ship to the US.

**For merchants, Perplexity offers:**
- Free API access to build Perplexity-powered search experiences
- Custom index refinement to include only your products
- Dashboard insights into search and shopping trends
- Visibility into which queries surface your products

Without advertising, merchant visibility depends entirely on product data quality, content optimization, and genuine relevance to user queries.

## Enterprise and Business Tools

Perplexity significantly expanded its enterprise offerings this month, targeting professional and organizational users.

### Enterprise Max Announced

Perplexity announced Enterprise Max, combining all Max capabilities with enterprise-grade security and controls.

**Two enterprise tiers:**

**Enterprise Pro** - $40/user/month ($400/year)
- Increased data privacy (user data never trains LLMs)
- SOC2 certification
- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- User management for adding/removing team members
- Identity-provider login
- Shared organizational "Spaces"
- Admin and audit controls
- Centralized billing
- Team collaboration tools

**Enterprise Max** - $325/user/month ($3,250/year)

Everything in Enterprise Pro, plus:
- Research mode with up to 100+ citations
- Labs for advanced data analysis and visualization
- Web app creation capabilities
- 10,000 file workspace storage
- 5,000 files in Spaces
- 15 high-quality videos per month (improved resolution and audio with Veo 3)
- Early access to premium data sources
- Exclusive releases like upcoming Email Assistant

### Notable Enterprise Clients

Perplexity's enterprise roster includes Stripe, Zoom, Databricks, Snowflake, Cleveland Cavaliers, HP, Vercel, and Replit.

These partnerships demonstrate Perplexity's positioning as a serious business intelligence and research tool, not just a consumer search engine.

### Spaces for Team Collaboration

Perplexity Spaces enables teams to:
- Share research projects
- Collaborate on queries
- Build institutional knowledge
- Maintain team-specific contexts and memories

This transforms Perplexity from an individual tool into a collaborative research platform.

### Developer and API Access

Perplexity offers API access for developers and businesses to:
- Build custom search experiences

- Create specialized knowledge bases
- Power internal tools with Perplexity's models

## Subscription-Focused Revenue Strategy

With advertising abandoned, Perplexity is aggressively pursuing subscription revenue.

### Revenue Target

Perplexity is targeting $500 million in annualized revenue by 2026, entirely from subscriptions. The company currently has:
- 100+ million users
- About $200 million in annualized revenue
- Subscription plans from $20 to $200 per month for individuals
- Enterprise plans up to $3,250 per user per year

### Three-Tier Consumer Strategy

**Free Tier:**
- Basic Perplexity search
- Limited model access
- Standard search capabilities
- Entry point for new users

**Pro Tier** - $20/month:
- Unlimited searches with advanced models
- GPT-5.2, Opus 4.6, and other frontier models
- Enhanced memory (95% recall)
- Buy with Pro shopping features
- Image generation with Seedream 4.5

**Max Tier** - $200/month:
- Everything in Pro
- Model Council (three models simultaneously)
- Deep Research with Opus 4.6
- Priority access to new features
- Maximum file upload limits

### Why This Matters for Brands

Perplexity's subscription focus means:

1. **Quality over quantity**: Perplexity optimizes for user satisfaction, not advertiser revenue
2. **Trust-first answers**: No concern about ad influence on results
3. **Organic visibility only**: You must earn placement through content quality
4. **Research-oriented users**: Subscribers are typically more engaged, researching purchases thoroughly
5. **Professional audience**: High-priced subscriptions attract business users and decision-makers

Searching for stocks (like "nvidia stock") in the Perplexity Android app now displays:
- Inline stock charts
- Expanded financial information
- Revamped controls for timeframe selection
- Real-time price data
- Historical performance visualization

These features position Perplexity as a research tool for investors and financial professionals.

### New Enterprise Security Controls

Enterprise Max includes enhanced security features:
- Advanced audit logging
- Data residency controls
- Custom retention policies
- Enhanced access management

## What Brands Should Do Now

The February 2026 updates fundamentally change how brands should approach Perplexity.

### 1. Abandon Paid Advertising Plans

If you were waiting for Perplexity advertising to become generally available, stop waiting. It's not coming back. Focus entirely on organic visibility.

### 2. Optimize Content for Citations

With no advertising option, getting cited as a source is your only path to visibility. Optimize for:
- Comprehensive answer content
- Proper structured data
- Clear, authoritative information
- Up-to-date product details
- Well-formatted technical specs

### 3. Integrate with Perplexity Shopping

If you're an e-commerce brand:
- Ensure Shopify product data is complete and accurate
- Use Perplexity's merchant API if available
- Optimize product descriptions for natural language queries
- Provide detailed specifications and attributes
- Create visual content for Snap to Shop

### 4. Build Topical Authority

Perplexity rewards genuine expertise. Create content that:
- Answers questions comprehensively
- Cites credible sources
- Provides unique insights
- Demonstrates subject matter expertise
- Updates regularly with new information

### 5. Monitor Your Perplexity Presence

Track how often Perplexity cites your brand:
- Run regular queries in your category
- Monitor which sources Perplexity prefers
- Analyze competitor citations
- Identify content gaps
- Measure citation frequency over time

### 6. Consider Enterprise Partnerships

If you're a B2B company, explore:
- Becoming a data partner
- Integration opportunities
- API-based product experiences
- Custom Perplexity deployments for clients

### 7. Target Perplexity Users Differently

Perplexity's subscription model means its users are:
- More research-oriented
- Willing to pay for quality
- Often business professionals
- Making informed purchase decisions
- Less impulse-driven

Adjust your content strategy accordingly. Provide depth, not flashy marketing.

## The Competitive Landscape

Perplexity's February moves create clear market positioning.

### Perplexity vs. ChatGPT

**Perplexity:**
- No advertising
- Subscription-focused
- Source-cited answers
- Research-oriented
- Professional/business users

**ChatGPT:**
- Launched advertising in February 2026

- Consumer-focused
- Mixed free and paid model

### Perplexity vs. Google

**Perplexity:**
- Direct answers
- AI-native experience
- No advertising influence
- Curated sources

**Google:**

- Comprehensive web index

### Market Opportunity

Perplexity's advertising abandonment creates an opening for brands that:
- Can compete on content quality
- Provide genuine expertise
- Don't rely on paid placement
- Serve research-oriented audiences

But it closes the door for brands that:
- Depend on paid visibility
- Lack strong organic content
- Need guaranteed placement
- Compete primarily on advertising spend

## Looking Ahead

Perplexity's February 2026 updates signal a clear strategic direction: become the trusted research platform for professionals, powered entirely by subscriptions.

### Expected Future Developments

Based on current trajectory, expect:
- More enterprise features and security controls
- Additional AI model integrations
- Enhanced shopping and commerce capabilities
- Deeper merchant partnerships
- API expansion for developers
- International market expansion

### The Trust Bet

Perplexity is making a fundamental bet that users will pay for trustworthy AI search untainted by advertising. If successful, this could reshape how AI platforms monetize.

### Implications for AI Search

Other AI platforms will watch closely. If Perplexity's subscription model succeeds, we may see:
- More ad-free AI search options
- Premium tiers across platforms
- Emphasis on trust and transparency
- Organic-only visibility becoming standard
