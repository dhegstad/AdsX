faqs:
  - question: "When should I migrate from Square Online to Shopify?"
    answer: "Consider migrating when you hit $100,000+ in online revenue, need advanced e-commerce features like subscriptions or complex shipping rules, want extensive app integrations, or find yourself limited by Square's catalog and customization constraints. If your online sales are outpacing your in-person sales and you need a platform built for e-commerce growth, Shopify is likely the better choice."
  - question: "Can I keep using Square POS if I move to Shopify?"
    answer: "Yes, but with limitations. You can continue using Square for in-person sales while running Shopify for online sales, but inventory won't sync automatically without third-party apps like SKU IQ or Syncy. Many businesses migrating to Shopify also consider transitioning to Shopify POS for unified inventory and reporting, especially if online sales dominate their business."
  - question: "How do Square Online fees compare to Shopify costs?"
    answer: "Square Online Free takes 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction with limited features. Square Online Plus costs $29/month plus 2.9% + $0.30. Shopify Basic costs $39/month with 2.9% + $0.30 transaction fees but includes far more e-commerce features. At higher volumes, Shopify becomes more cost-effective, especially considering the revenue potential from advanced features Square lacks."
  - question: "Will I lose my Square customer data when migrating?"
    answer: "No, you can export your customer data from Square before migrating. Square allows CSV exports of your customer directory including names, emails, phone numbers, and purchase history. Import this data into Shopify to maintain your customer relationships and immediately begin email marketing campaigns to your existing audience."
  - question: "What are the biggest limitations of Square Online compared to Shopify?"
    answer: "Square Online's main limitations include: restricted product variant options (max 250 variants vs Shopify's 100 per product but unlimited products), limited app ecosystem (100+ vs 8,000+), basic customization options, fewer payment gateways, no native subscription capabilities, limited B2B features, basic shipping options, and constrained SEO and marketing tools. These limitations become increasingly problematic as online revenue grows."

Square Online made sense when you started. You already had Square for in-person payments, adding online sales was free, and setup took an afternoon. For a retail store or service business dipping a toe into e-commerce, it was the obvious choice.

But something has changed.

Maybe your online orders now outpace walk-in customers. Maybe you've hit walls trying to customize your store or add features Square doesn't support. Maybe you're watching competitors with "real" e-commerce stores offer subscriptions, loyalty programs, and shopping experiences you can't match.

If Square Online is starting to feel like a T-shirt you've outgrown, this guide is for you. We'll cover when migration makes sense, what you gain (and what you might miss), and how to execute the transition without disrupting your business.

## Why Businesses Start with Square Online

Before discussing migration, let's acknowledge why Square Online is genuinely excellent for many businesses.

### The Square Ecosystem Advantage

If you're a retail store, restaurant, or service business already using Square POS, Square Online offers:

- **Zero additional cost** to start (Free plan available)
- **Instant integration** with your existing Square account
- **Unified inventory** across in-person and online sales
- **Single dashboard** for all transactions
- **Familiar interface** if you already know Square
- **Fast setup** with pre-built templates

For a coffee shop adding online ordering, a boutique testing e-commerce, or a salon selling products alongside services, Square Online eliminates friction. You're already in the ecosystem.

### Where Square Online Excels

Square Online genuinely works well for:

- **Low-volume online sellers** (under $50K annual online revenue)
- **Service businesses** with simple booking and product sales
- **Restaurants** using Square for POS with online ordering
- **Retail stores** where in-person sales dominate
- **Simple product catalogs** (fewer than 100 SKUs)
- **Businesses testing e-commerce viability**

If this describes you, Square Online might still be the right platform. Migration has costs, and "if it ain't broke" applies.

But if you're reading this article, something probably *is* broken.

## Signs You've Outgrown Square Online

### Online Revenue Exceeding $100K Annually

When online sales cross six figures, platform limitations compound into real money left on the table:

- Missing features cost sales you'll never see
- Limited customization hurts conversion rates
- Basic analytics prevent data-driven optimization
- App ecosystem gaps block automation and scaling

At $100K+ online revenue, you need a platform built for e-commerce growth, not an add-on to a POS system.

### Product Catalog Complexity

Square Online struggles with:

- **More than 250 variant combinations** per product
- **Products with many customization options**
- **Large catalogs** (becomes unwieldy above 500 SKUs)
- **Complex pricing structures** (wholesale, tiered, etc.)
- **Product bundles and kits**

If you're creating workarounds for product limitations, you've outgrown the platform.

### Need for Advanced E-commerce Features

Square Online lacks or severely limits:

- **Subscriptions and recurring orders**
- **Advanced discount logic** (buy X get Y, spend thresholds, etc.)
- **Abandoned cart recovery** (limited on lower plans)
- **Customer accounts with order history**
- **Wishlist functionality**
- **Product reviews** (native, not third-party)
- **Gift cards with advanced options**
- **Loyalty programs** (basic compared to dedicated solutions)
- **Pre-orders and backorders**
- **Advanced inventory management**

If your competitors offer these features and you can't, you're losing sales.

### Marketing and SEO Limitations

Square Online provides basic tools, but growth-oriented businesses need:

- **Full SEO control** (meta descriptions, URLs, structured data)
- **Blog functionality** for content marketing
- **Advanced email marketing integration**
- **Conversion tracking pixels** across all platforms
- **A/B testing capabilities**
- **Advanced analytics and reporting**
- **Marketing automation triggers**

If you're fighting the platform to implement basic marketing, it's time to move.

### Integration Requirements

Square Online's app ecosystem is limited compared to dedicated e-commerce platforms:

| Category | Square Online | Shopify |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Total Apps | ~100 | 8,000+ |
| Email Marketing | Basic | Klaviyo, Omnisend, Mailchimp, etc. |
| Reviews | Limited | Judge.me, Loox, Stamped, Yotpo |
| Subscriptions | None native | Recharge, Bold, Skio |
| Loyalty | Basic | Smile.io, LoyaltyLion |
| Shipping | Limited | ShipStation, Shippo, Easyship |
| Analytics | Basic | Triple Whale, Lifetimely, etc. |

If you need specific integrations Square doesn't support, you've hit a dead end.

### Customer Experience Gaps

Modern e-commerce expectations include:

- **Fast, smooth checkout** optimized for conversion
- **Guest checkout** without friction
- **Multiple payment options** (BNPL, crypto, etc.)
- **Personalized shopping experiences**
- **Mobile-first design** with app-like experiences
- **Real-time inventory and shipping estimates**

Square Online delivers a functional but basic experience. As expectations rise, "functional" isn't enough.

## What You Gain by Moving to Shopify

### True E-commerce Architecture

Shopify is built from the ground up for online selling. Every feature, update, and improvement focuses on e-commerce success.

- **Conversion-optimized checkout** (Shop Pay increases conversions 1.7x)
- **Mobile-first responsive themes**
- **Product pages designed for sales**
- **Cart functionality optimized over years**
- **Checkout extensibility for customization**

The difference is similar to comparing a Swiss Army knife (Square) to a chef's knife (Shopify). Both cut, but one is purpose-built.

### Unlimited Scalability

Shopify handles businesses from $10K to $1B+ in annual revenue:

- No performance degradation as you grow
- Infrastructure handles traffic spikes (Flash sales, viral moments)
- Feature set that grows with you
- Shopify Plus available for enterprise needs
- Global infrastructure for international expansion

You'll never need another platform migration due to scale.

### The App Ecosystem

Shopify's 8,000+ apps enable virtually any e-commerce capability:

**Marketing:**
- Klaviyo (email/SMS marketing)
- Privy (popups and email capture)
- Postscript (SMS marketing)
- Gorgias (customer service)

**Conversion:**
- Judge.me (product reviews)
- ReConvert (post-purchase upsells)
- Bold Upsell (in-cart offers)
- Back in Stock (inventory notifications)

**Operations:**

- QuickBooks/Xero (accounting)

**Subscriptions:**
- Recharge (subscriptions platform)

- Skio (newer alternative)

**Loyalty:**
- Smile.io (loyalty program)
- LoyaltyLion
- Yotpo Loyalty

Any business problem has multiple app solutions competing to serve you.

### Advanced Analytics and Reporting

Shopify provides:

- **Detailed sales reports** by product, variant, channel
- **Customer lifetime value** tracking
- **Acquisition reports** showing traffic sources
- **Inventory reports** with forecasting
- **Finance reports** for accounting
- **Custom report builder**

Third-party apps add:

- Customer cohort analysis
- Profit and loss tracking
- Advertising attribution
- Predictive analytics

Data-driven decisions become possible.

### Marketing Control

Full access to:

- **SEO tools** (meta tags, URLs, structured data, sitemap)
- **Native blogging** for content marketing
- **Abandoned cart emails** (automated, customizable)
- **Discount code engine** with complex logic
- **Customer segmentation** for targeted marketing
- **Marketing automation** through apps
- **Full pixel support** (Meta, Google, TikTok, etc.)

You control the levers that drive growth.

### Payment Flexibility

Shopify offers:

- **Shopify Payments** (built-in, competitive rates)
- **100+ payment gateways** if needed
- **Shop Pay** (accelerated checkout, higher conversion)
- **Buy now, pay later** options (Shop Pay Installments, Klarna, Affirm)
- **Cryptocurrency** acceptance (optional)
- **Multi-currency** support for international sales

Customers can pay however they prefer.

### Customer Experience Features

- **Customer accounts** with full order history
- **Wishlist functionality** (via apps)
- **Product recommendations** (personalized)
- **Gift cards** with advanced options
- **Store credit** management
- **Loyalty program** integration

Every feature that makes customers return is available.

## The Square to Shopify Comparison

### Feature Comparison Table

| Feature | Square Online Plus | Shopify Basic |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Monthly Cost | $29 | $39 |
| Transaction Fees | 2.9% + $0.30 | 2.9% + $0.30 (Shopify Payments) |
| Products | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Product Variants | 250 total combinations | 100 per product, unlimited products |
| Staff Accounts | Unlimited | 2 (more on higher plans) |
| Abandoned Cart | Email only | Email + automations |
| Discount Codes | Basic | Advanced logic |
| Gift Cards | Yes | Yes |
| Customer Reviews | No (native) | Yes (via apps) |
| Blog | No | Yes |
| SEO Tools | Basic | Advanced |
| App Integrations | ~100 | 8,000+ |
| Subscriptions | No | Yes (via apps) |
| Themes | 10+ | 130+ (free and paid) |
| Custom Code | Limited | Full access (Liquid) |
| B2B/Wholesale | No | Yes |
| Multi-channel | Limited | Extensive |

### Cost Comparison at Scale

**At $100,000 Annual Online Revenue:**

| Cost Category | Square Online Plus | Shopify Basic |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Platform Subscription | $348/year | $468/year |
| Transaction Fees | $2,900 | $2,900 |
| Payment Processing | $0 (included) | $0 (Shopify Payments) |
| Essential Apps | $0 | ~$1,200/year |
| **Total** | **$3,248** | **$4,568** |
| **Percentage** | **3.2%** | **4.6%** |

But this misses the point. The question isn't just cost—it's revenue potential.

### The Revenue Opportunity Gap

Consider features Shopify enables that Square lacks:

| Feature | Potential Revenue Impact |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Abandoned cart recovery | +10-15% recovered sales |
| Subscriptions | +20-30% customer LTV |
| Loyalty program | +5-10% repeat purchase rate |
| Advanced email marketing | +20-30% of total revenue |
| Conversion-optimized checkout | +10-20% conversion rate |
| Upsells and cross-sells | +10-25% average order value |

A business doing $100K on Square Online might do $130K-$150K on Shopify with the same traffic, simply through better conversion and retention tools.

**The calculus:** Paying $1,300 more annually to unlock $30,000+ in additional revenue isn't a cost—it's an investment.

## What You Might Miss from Square

Let's be honest about trade-offs.

### Seamless POS Integration

If you rely heavily on Square POS for in-person sales:

- **Square Online** syncs inventory automatically
- **Shopify** requires either Shopify POS or third-party sync apps

Solutions:
- Migrate to Shopify POS (excellent for retail, requires hardware investment)
- Use inventory sync apps (SKU IQ, Syncy, Trunk)
- Manually manage if volume is low

If in-person sales significantly outweigh online, this friction matters.

### Simplicity

Square Online is genuinely simple:

- Less to learn
- Fewer decisions to make
- Limited customization means less to break
- Single ecosystem for everything

Shopify offers more power but requires more learning. The app ecosystem can be overwhelming. Theme customization has a learning curve.

If "simple" is a priority, acknowledge this trade-off.

### All-in-One Financial Ecosystem

Square offers:

- Square Banking
- Square Loans
- Square Payroll
- Unified reporting

Moving to Shopify separates your e-commerce from these services. You can still use Square for in-person sales, but systems become less integrated.

### Lower Starting Cost

Square Online Free exists. Shopify's lowest full store plan is $39/month.

For businesses doing minimal online sales, Square's free option genuinely makes sense.

## Step-by-Step Migration Process

### Phase 1: Planning and Preparation (Week 1)

**1. Audit your current setup**

Document:
- Number of products and variants
- Customer database size
- Order history requirements
- Integrations you use
- Marketing tools and pixels
- Current traffic and sales

**2. Map feature requirements**

Create a list:
- Must-have features (deal-breakers if missing)
- Nice-to-have features
- Integrations needed
- Customization requirements

**3. Choose your Shopify plan**

| Plan | Monthly Cost | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Basic | $39 | Under $100K revenue |
| Shopify | $105 | $100K-$500K revenue |
| Advanced | $399 | $500K+ revenue |
| Plus | $2,000+ | Enterprise |

Most Square Online migrants start with Basic and upgrade as needed.

**4. Plan for POS transition (if applicable)**

Decide:
- Keep Square POS + use sync apps?
- Migrate to Shopify POS?
- Run separate inventories?

This is often the most complex decision for retail businesses.

### Phase 2: Shopify Setup (Weeks 1-2)

**1. Start your free trial**

[Begin your Shopify free trial](https://www.shopify.com/free-trial). You get 3 days free, then $1/month for 3 months—plenty of time to build before committing.

**2. Select and configure theme**

Recommended free themes for Square Online migrants:
- **Dawn** (default, clean, fast)
- **Craft** (good for handmade/artisan products)
- **Refresh** (retail-focused)
- **Sense** (minimal, elegant)

Match your current brand aesthetic. You can customize later.

**3. Set up domain**

Options:
- Connect existing domain (if you own one)
- Buy through Shopify
- Use Shopify subdomain temporarily

If you have an existing domain with Square, you'll transfer this.

**4. Configure settings**

- Store name and contact information
- Currency and units
- Tax settings (automatic calculation available)
- Shipping zones and rates
- Payment methods (set up Shopify Payments)

### Phase 3: Data Migration (Weeks 2-3)

**1. Export from Square**

From Square Dashboard:
- **Products:** Items > Export Items (CSV)
- **Customers:** Customers > Export (CSV)
- **Orders:** Transactions > Export (for records)

**2. Prepare data for import**

Square's CSV format differs from Shopify's. You'll need to:
- Map fields correctly
- Reformat variant structures
- Clean up data inconsistencies
- Add any missing information

Shopify provides [import templates](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/import-export/using-csv) you can follow.

**3. Import products**

Options:
- **Shopify CSV import** (built-in, works for most cases)
- **Migration apps** (Matrixify, Cart2Cart) for complex catalogs
- **Manual entry** for small catalogs (opportunity to improve listings)

Start with a test batch. Verify images, variants, and pricing before importing everything.

**4. Import customers**

Use Shopify's customer import to bring over:
- Names and contact info
- Marketing consent status
- Customer notes
- Tags for segmentation

Preserve purchase history if possible through notes or tags.

**5. Don't import old orders**

Generally, don't import order history into Shopify. Keep Square for historical records. This avoids data messiness and reporting confusion.

### Phase 4: Store Buildout (Weeks 3-4)

**1. Optimize product listings**

Don't just copy Square listings. Improve:
- High-quality photography
- Detailed descriptions (features, benefits, specifications)
- SEO-optimized titles
- Clear pricing and variant structure
- Size guides, care instructions, etc.

**2. Create collections**

Organize products logically:
- By category
- By use case
- By price point
- Seasonal collections
- Sale/clearance

**3. Build essential pages**

- About Us
- Contact
- Shipping Policy
- Return Policy
- Privacy Policy
- Terms of Service
- FAQ

Use Shopify's free policy generators as starting points.

**4. Set up navigation**

Create intuitive menus:
- Main navigation (header)
- Footer navigation
- Mobile menu structure

Test on mobile devices extensively.

### Phase 5: App Installation (Week 4)

**Essential apps for most stores:**

| Category | Recommended Apps |
|----------|------------------|
| Email Marketing | Klaviyo or Mailchimp |
| Reviews | Judge.me or Loox |
| SEO | JSON-LD for SEO |
| Analytics | Google Analytics 4 (free) |
| Shipping | Shippo or ShipStation |
| Popups/Capture | Privy or Klaviyo |

**Install based on needs, not popularity.** Start minimal and add as required.

**Configure each app thoroughly.** Half-configured apps waste money and create friction.

### Phase 6: Marketing Setup (Week 4-5)

**1. Email marketing configuration**

- Import email list from Square
- Create welcome sequence (3-5 emails)
- Set up abandoned cart emails
- Design promotional templates
- Configure signup forms

**2. Install tracking pixels**

- Google Analytics 4
- Meta (Facebook) Pixel
- Google Ads conversion tracking
- Any other advertising platforms

**3. SEO setup**

- Meta titles and descriptions for all pages
- Image alt text
- Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
- Verify site ownership

**4. Social media integration**

- Connect Facebook/Instagram Shop
- Set up Google Shopping feed
- Configure Pinterest if applicable

### Phase 7: Testing and Launch (Week 5-6)

**1. Complete thorough testing**

- Place test orders
- Test all payment methods
- Verify shipping calculations
- Check email notifications
- Test on mobile devices
- Verify discount codes work
- Check integrations

**2. Soft launch**

Before announcing widely:
- Process a few real orders
- Identify any issues
- Verify fulfillment workflow
- Confirm all automations trigger

**3. DNS and domain transfer**

When ready:
- Update DNS to point to Shopify
- Verify SSL certificate works
- Test all links and bookmarks

**4. Official launch**

- Announce to email list
- Update social media links
- Update Google Business Profile
- Redirect any old URLs if necessary

## Running Square and Shopify Simultaneously

For many businesses, a gradual transition works better than hard cutover.

### The Hybrid Approach

**Keep Square for:**
- In-person POS sales
- Local pickup orders
- Simple repeat orders from regulars

**Use Shopify for:**
- All new online marketing efforts
- Subscription products
- New customer acquisition
- Advanced promotions

### Inventory Sync Solutions

If running both platforms with shared inventory:

- **SKU IQ** (~$45-125/month) - Dedicated Square-Shopify sync
- **Syncy** (~$25-50/month) - Multi-platform inventory
- **Trunk** (~$35-100/month) - Inventory management

These apps sync inventory counts to prevent overselling.

### Gradual Customer Migration

**Week 1-4:** Launch Shopify quietly, test with existing customers
**Month 2-3:** Promote website to email list, add Shopify link everywhere
**Month 3-6:** Shift marketing spend to drive traffic to Shopify
**Month 6+:** Evaluate whether Square Online is still needed

### When to Fully Transition

Consider shutting down Square Online when:
- Shopify handles 80%+ of online revenue
- Maintaining two platforms creates operational burden
- POS sync issues outweigh benefits
- You've moved to Shopify POS

Some businesses keep Square Online indefinitely for specific use cases. There's no wrong answer if it serves your business.

## Integration Considerations

### Email Marketing Migration

If moving from Square Marketing:

1. Export your Square subscriber list
2. Import to Klaviyo, Mailchimp, or Omnisend
3. Rebuild automation workflows
4. Update signup forms and capture points
5. Test deliverability before major sends

Shopify's email marketing app ecosystem far exceeds Square's capabilities.

### Shipping and Fulfillment

Square Online offers basic shipping. Shopify enables:

- **Shopify Shipping** (built-in carrier rates)
- **ShipStation** (multi-carrier management)
- **ShipBob** (3PL fulfillment)
- **Shippo** (flexible shipping solution)
- **Easyship** (international focus)

Evaluate your shipping needs and choose appropriate tools.

### Accounting Integration

If using QuickBooks, Xero, or other accounting software:

- Shopify integrates directly with major accounting platforms
- Set up sync before processing orders
- Verify tax handling matches your configuration
- Test reconciliation with sample transactions

### Review Migration

If you have reviews on Square:
- Export review content manually
- Import to Shopify review app (Judge.me, Loox support import)
- Request new reviews from existing customers
- Consider migration as opportunity to rebuild social proof

## Common Migration Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Rushing the Transition

**The error:** Moving everything to Shopify in a weekend.

**The reality:** Rushed migrations create data problems, broken workflows, and customer confusion.

**The fix:** Plan 6-8 weeks for a proper transition. Test thoroughly before going live.

### Mistake 2: Copying Listings Without Improvement

**The error:** Importing Square product data exactly as-is.

**The reality:** Migration is your opportunity to optimize every listing.

**The fix:** Treat migration as a catalog refresh. Improve photos, descriptions, and organization.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring the POS Question

**The error:** Not planning for inventory sync between Square POS and Shopify.

**The reality:** Overselling damages customer trust. Inventory discrepancies create operational chaos.

**The fix:** Decide your POS strategy upfront. Implement sync solution before going live.

### Mistake 4: Not Training Staff

**The error:** Launching without preparing your team.

**The reality:** Staff frustrated with new systems create customer service issues.

**The fix:** Train everyone who touches the platform. Document processes. Allow practice time.

### Mistake 5: Skipping Analytics Setup

**The error:** Going live without tracking in place.

**The reality:** You can't optimize what you can't measure.

**The fix:** Configure Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, and Shopify Analytics before launch.

### Mistake 6: Underestimating App Costs

**The error:** Assuming Shopify's base price is your total cost.

**The reality:** Apps add $50-500+/month depending on needs.

**The fix:** Budget for essential apps. Calculate total platform cost before committing.

### Mistake 7: Not Setting Up Email Capture Immediately

**The error:** Launching without email collection.

**The reality:** Every visitor who doesn't leave an email is likely lost forever.

**The fix:** Install email capture before launch. Offer incentive for signup.
