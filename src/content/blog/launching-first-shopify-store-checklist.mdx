  - question: "How long does it take to launch a Shopify store?"
    answer: "A basic Shopify store can be launched in 1-2 weeks if you work on it daily. However, for a properly optimized store with all legal pages, tested checkout, email capture, and analytics, plan for 3-4 weeks. Rushing the launch often leads to costly mistakes and poor first impressions with customers."
  - question: "What do I need before launching my Shopify store?"
    answer: "Essential pre-launch requirements include: completed product listings with high-quality photos, payment processing setup (Shopify Payments or alternative), shipping rates configured, legal pages (privacy policy, terms, refund policy), a connected domain, at least one test order completed, email capture form, and Google Analytics connected. Don't launch without testing your entire checkout process."
  - question: "How much does it cost to launch a Shopify store?"
    answer: "Minimum costs include Shopify Basic at $39/month, a domain at $14-18/year, and payment processing fees (2.9% + $0.30 per transaction with Shopify Payments). Optional but recommended: email marketing app ($0-20/month), review app ($0-15/month), and marketing budget ($100-500 for initial advertising). Total startup: approximately $100-200 for the first month."
  - question: "What's the biggest mistake new Shopify store owners make at launch?"
    answer: "The biggest mistake is launching without testing the complete customer journey—from browsing to checkout to order confirmation emails. Many new store owners skip test orders, only to discover broken checkout flows, incorrect shipping calculations, or missing confirmation emails after real customers have had bad experiences."
  - question: "Should I wait until my store is perfect before launching?"
    answer: "No. Launch when your store is 'good enough'—meaning payments work, checkout is tested, legal pages exist, and products look professional. Perfectionism causes analysis paralysis. You can (and will) improve everything after launch based on real customer feedback. A shipped store beats a perfect concept every time."

You've picked your products, chosen your theme, and written your product descriptions. Your Shopify store is almost ready. But before you flip that switch and open for business, there's a critical question: **Is your store actually ready for customers?**

The difference between a successful launch and a frustrating first week often comes down to preparation. Stores that launch with broken checkout flows, missing policies, or untested systems lose their first customers permanently—and those customers tell their friends.

This comprehensive checklist covers everything you need to verify before launch day, what to focus on during your first week, and how to recover if things don't go as planned. Bookmark this page and check off each item before you go live.

## Pre-Launch Essentials Checklist

Before anything else, make sure these foundational elements are in place.

### Account and Business Basics

- [ ] **Business name finalized** — Your store name, legal business name, and domain should align
- [ ] **Shopify plan selected** — Basic ($39/month) works for most new stores
- [ ] **Custom domain connected** — yourstore.com, not yourstore.myshopify.com
- [ ] **Store timezone set correctly** — Affects order timestamps and reports
- [ ] **Store currency configured** — Match your primary market
- [ ] **Contact email is professional** — hello@yourstore.com, not personal Gmail

### Legal Business Requirements

- [ ] **Business structure decided** — Sole proprietor, LLC, or corporation
- [ ] **Tax ID obtained** — EIN for US businesses, or equivalent
- [ ] **Business bank account opened** — Keep business and personal finances separate
- [ ] **Business address determined** — Can be home address or virtual office
- [ ] **Sales tax registration** — Required in states where you have nexus

These might seem administrative, but customers check for legitimacy. A store with a professional email and clear business identity converts better than one with hello123@gmail.com.

---

## Store Design Must-Haves

Your design doesn't need to be perfect, but it needs to be professional and functional.

### Homepage Essentials

- [ ] **Clear value proposition above the fold** — Visitors should understand what you sell in 3 seconds
- [ ] **Professional logo** — Simple is better than complex; Canva works fine for starting
- [ ] **High-quality hero image** — First impression matters enormously
- [ ] **Navigation is logical** — Can customers find products in 2 clicks?
- [ ] **Featured products visible** — Show your bestsellers or hero products
- [ ] **Mobile-responsive** — Test on actual phones, not just browser resize

### Sitewide Design Elements

- [ ] **Consistent branding** — Same colors, fonts, and tone throughout
- [ ] **Fast loading speed** — Under 3 seconds; compress images if needed
- [ ] **Working search function** — Customers expect to search by name
- [ ] **Clear footer** — Contact info, policies, social links, newsletter signup
- [ ] **Favicon set** — The small icon in browser tabs; shows professionalism
- [ ] **404 page customized** — Redirect lost visitors to useful pages

### Trust Signals

- [ ] **About page completed** — Tell your story; people buy from people
- [ ] **Contact page with multiple options** — Email, phone (even if Google Voice), contact form
- [ ] **Physical address displayed** — Required legally in many jurisdictions; builds trust
- [ ] **Social media linked** — Even if accounts are new, they add legitimacy
- [ ] **Security badges visible** — "Secure checkout" messaging near buy buttons

**First-time store owner tip:** Use Shopify's free themes initially. Dawn, Craft, and Sense are professional and fast. Don't invest in premium themes until you've validated your products are selling.

---

## Product Page Optimization

Your product pages do the selling. They need to work hard.

### Product Information

- [ ] **Compelling product titles** — Clear, descriptive, include key features
- [ ] **Detailed descriptions** — Answer every question a customer might have
- [ ] **Specifications listed** — Size, weight, materials, dimensions
- [ ] **Multiple high-quality images** — At least 4-5 per product, different angles
- [ ] **Image zoom works** — Customers want to see details
- [ ] **Lifestyle images included** — Products in use, not just white background

### Product Page Functionality

- [ ] **Price clearly displayed** — Including any sale/compare-at pricing
- [ ] **Variants work correctly** — Size, color, style selectors function properly
- [ ] **Inventory tracking enabled** — Avoid selling items you don't have
- [ ] **Add to cart button prominent** — Above the fold, contrasting color
- [ ] **Quantity selector visible** — Let customers buy multiples easily
- [ ] **Buy button text tested** — "Add to Cart" or "Buy Now"—test what works

### Product Page Trust Elements

- [ ] **Shipping information on product page** — "Free shipping over $50" or delivery estimate
- [ ] **Return policy snippet** — "30-day returns" link near buy button
- [ ] **Reviews section ready** — Even if empty, the structure should exist
- [ ] **Social proof if available** — "500+ sold" or customer photos

### SEO for Product Pages

- [ ] **Meta titles optimized** — Include product name and key feature
- [ ] **Meta descriptions written** — Compelling summaries with call to action
- [ ] **Image alt text added** — Describe each image for accessibility and SEO
- [ ] **URL handles clean** — /products/blue-running-shoes not /products/sku-12345

**Pro tip:** Your product descriptions should answer the questions "What is it?", "Who is it for?", "Why should I buy it?", and "What makes it different?" in that order.

---

## Payment and Shipping Setup Verification

Nothing kills a sale faster than checkout problems.

### Payment Processing

- [ ] **Shopify Payments activated** — Lowest fees, easiest setup
- [ ] **PayPal connected** — Many customers prefer it (alternative payment method)
- [ ] **Payment capture set correctly** — Automatic vs. manual capture decided
- [ ] **Accepted card types displayed** — Visa, Mastercard, Amex logos visible
- [ ] **Payment testing completed** — More on this in the test orders section
- [ ] **Currency display correct** — Matching your primary market

### Shipping Configuration

- [ ] **Shipping zones created** — Domestic, international, or specific regions
- [ ] **Shipping rates set** — Flat rate, calculated, or free over threshold
- [ ] **Free shipping threshold** — $50 or $75 works for most stores
- [ ] **Shipping carrier accounts connected** — USPS, UPS, FedEx, or others
- [ ] **Package dimensions entered** — For accurate calculated rates
- [ ] **Handling time realistic** — Don't promise 1-day shipping if you can't deliver
- [ ] **International shipping decided** — Enabled or disabled, with clear messaging

### Shipping Presentation

- [ ] **Shipping policy page complete** — Delivery times, costs, carriers
- [ ] **Cart page shows shipping estimate** — Before checkout if possible
- [ ] **Free shipping progress bar** — "Add $15 more for free shipping!"
- [ ] **Local pickup configured** — If applicable to your business

**Common mistake:** Setting shipping rates too low to seem competitive, then losing money on every order. Calculate your actual costs including packaging materials, and price accordingly.

---

## Legal Pages (Privacy, Terms, Refund Policy)

These aren't optional. They're legally required in most jurisdictions and build customer trust.

### Required Legal Pages

- [ ] **Privacy Policy** — What data you collect, how you use it, who you share with
- [ ] **Terms of Service** — Rules for using your website and buying from you
- [ ] **Refund/Return Policy** — Clear conditions, timeframes, process
- [ ] **Shipping Policy** — Delivery times, carriers, international availability
- [ ] **Cookie Policy** — Required in EU/UK if you use cookies (you do)

### Legal Page Best Practices

- [ ] **Written in plain English** — Avoid unnecessary legal jargon
- [ ] **Easy to find** — Linked in footer on every page
- [ ] **Specific to your business** — Not generic templates
- [ ] **Last updated date included** — Shows policies are current
- [ ] **Contact information included** — How to reach you about policy questions

### What to Include in Your Refund Policy

Your refund policy significantly impacts conversion. Include:

- **Return window** — 30 days is standard; 60-90 days builds more trust
- **Condition requirements** — Unworn, tags attached, original packaging
- **Who pays return shipping** — Customer or you; be clear
- **Refund method** — Original payment method, store credit, or choice
- **Timeline** — How long until refund processes
- **Exceptions** — Final sale items, hygiene products, custom items

**Shopify tip:** Shopify can auto-generate basic legal pages through **Settings > Policies > Create from template**. These are a starting point—customize them for your specific business.

---

## Test Orders and Checkout Testing

This is the step most new store owners skip—and the one that causes the most launch problems.

### Enabling Test Mode

Shopify offers two testing methods:

**1. Bogus Gateway (for testing flow)**
- Settings > Payments > Add payment method > Bogus Gateway
- Use card number "1" with any expiration and CVV
- Free, tests the flow but not actual payment processing

**2. Real Transaction Testing**
- Use Shopify Payments with a real card
- Complete a real purchase, then refund immediately
- Tests the actual payment flow; costs nothing after refund

### What to Test

- [ ] **Add to cart functionality** — Products add correctly with right variants
- [ ] **Cart updates work** — Quantity changes, item removal
- [ ] **Discount codes apply** — Test any launch codes you've created
- [ ] **Shipping calculates correctly** — Check multiple addresses
- [ ] **Tax calculates correctly** — Verify rates for your tax jurisdictions
- [ ] **Checkout completes** — All the way through to confirmation
- [ ] **Order confirmation page displays** — With order number and details
- [ ] **Order confirmation email sends** — Check content and formatting
- [ ] **Order appears in admin** — Viewable in Orders section
- [ ] **Mobile checkout works** — Complete entire process on phone

### Test Multiple Scenarios

- [ ] **Single item order** — Basic purchase flow
- [ ] **Multiple items order** — Cart totals correctly
- [ ] **Different variants** — Size/color combinations
- [ ] **Different shipping addresses** — Various zones if applicable
- [ ] **Guest checkout** — Not logged in
- [ ] **Account checkout** — Customer with account
- [ ] **Failed payment** — Use test card that declines

### Post-Purchase Testing

- [ ] **Order confirmation email received** — Check spam folder too
- [ ] **Shipping notification ready** — Test fulfillment workflow
- [ ] **Refund process works** — Practice the refund flow
- [ ] **Customer notifications correct** — All automated emails reviewed

**Critical:** Don't launch without completing at least one full test order on both desktop and mobile. The 10 minutes you spend testing saves hours of customer service later.

## SEO Basics Before Launch

You won't rank #1 on Google at launch, but setting up SEO properly from day one compounds over time.

### Technical SEO Setup

- [ ] **Google Search Console connected** — Submit sitemap, monitor indexing
- [ ] **Google Analytics 4 installed** — Track traffic from day one
- [ ] **Sitemap submitted** — Shopify auto-generates at yourstore.com/sitemap.xml
- [ ] **Site is indexable** — Remove password protection before launch
- [ ] **Robots.txt correct** — Shopify handles this, but verify
- [ ] **SSL certificate active** — HTTPS enabled (Shopify includes this free)

### On-Page SEO

- [ ] **Homepage meta title optimized** — Brand name + what you sell
- [ ] **Homepage meta description written** — Compelling summary with value prop
- [ ] **Collection page titles optimized** — Include category keywords
- [ ] **Product titles include keywords** — Natural, not stuffed
- [ ] **All images have alt text** — Descriptive, includes relevant keywords
- [ ] **URL structure is clean** — No random numbers or parameters

### Content for SEO

- [ ] **About page has substantial content** — 300+ words about your brand
- [ ] **FAQ page created** — Answer common questions; good for SEO
- [ ] **Blog section exists** — Even if empty at launch; plan to add content
- [ ] **Contact page is complete** — Include business name and location

### Local SEO (If Applicable)

- [ ] **Google Business Profile created** — Even for online-only stores
- [ ] **NAP consistent** — Name, Address, Phone same everywhere
- [ ] **Local keywords included** — If you target a specific region

**Reality check:** SEO takes 3-6 months to show results. Focus on paid traffic and social media for initial sales, while building SEO foundation for long-term organic traffic.

---

## Email Capture Setup

Your email list will become your most valuable marketing asset. Set up capture from day one.

### Email Marketing Platform

- [ ] **Email platform chosen and connected** — Klaviyo, Mailchimp, or Omnisend
- [ ] **Shopify integration working** — Customer data syncing
- [ ] **List created for subscribers** — Separate from customer list
- [ ] **Double opt-in configured** — Required in many regions (GDPR)
- [ ] **Unsubscribe works** — Test it; legally required

### Email Capture Forms

- [ ] **Pop-up configured** — 10% off first order in exchange for email
- [ ] **Trigger timing set** — 5-10 seconds delay, or exit intent
- [ ] **Mobile-friendly pop-up** — Doesn't block entire screen
- [ ] **Footer signup form** — For those who dismiss pop-up
- [ ] **Checkout opt-in enabled** — "Send me news and offers"
- [ ] **Lead magnet considered** — Style guide, sizing chart, discount code

### Essential Automated Emails

- [ ] **Welcome email created** — Introduce brand, deliver promised discount
- [ ] **Abandoned cart series** — 3 emails: 1 hour, 24 hours, 72 hours
- [ ] **Order confirmation** — Shopify default or customized
- [ ] **Shipping notification** — With tracking information
- [ ] **Review request email** — 7-14 days after delivery

### Email Capture Best Practices

**Offer something valuable** for the email. Options include:
- 10-15% off first order (most effective)
- Free shipping on first order
- Exclusive access to sales
- Helpful content (style guide, tips)
- Entry into giveaway

**Pro tip:** Set your pop-up to show after 5-10 seconds on page, not immediately. Let visitors see your products first. Alternatively, use exit-intent triggers.

---

## Analytics and Tracking

You can't improve what you don't measure. Set up tracking before launch so you have data from day one.

### Essential Analytics Setup

- [ ] **Google Analytics 4 installed** — The foundation of your analytics
- [ ] **Enhanced e-commerce tracking enabled** — Product views, add to cart, purchases
- [ ] **Conversion tracking verified** — Test purchase shows in GA4
- [ ] **Shopify Analytics reviewed** — Built-in dashboard works immediately
- [ ] **Goals/conversions configured** — Track email signups, not just sales

### Advertising Pixels (Set Up Now, Use Later)

- [ ] **Facebook/Meta Pixel installed** — Even if not advertising yet
- [ ] **TikTok Pixel installed** — If your audience is there
- [ ] **Pinterest Tag installed** — If relevant to your products
- [ ] **Google Ads conversion tracking** — For when you start paid search

**Why install pixels before advertising?** Pixels collect audience data immediately. Even if you don't advertise for months, you'll have a retargeting audience and conversion data ready when you start.

### Tracking Checklist

- [ ] **UTM parameters understood** — For tracking traffic sources
- [ ] **Link shortener or tracker ready** — For social and email links
- [ ] **Spreadsheet for manual tracking** — Sales, traffic, conversion rates
- [ ] **Regular reporting schedule planned** — Weekly review of key metrics

### Key Metrics to Track From Day One

| Metric | Why It Matters | Target Range |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Conversion rate** | Visitors to buyers | 1-3% starting out |
| **Average order value** | Revenue per transaction | Product dependent |
| **Cart abandonment rate** | Lost sales opportunity | Under 70% is good |
| **Traffic sources** | Where customers come from | Diversify over time |
| **Email signup rate** | List building effectiveness | 2-5% of visitors |

---

## Launch Day Strategy

The day you launch matters. Plan it intentionally.

### Pre-Launch Day Preparation

- [ ] **Launch date chosen** — Tuesday-Thursday typically better than weekends
- [ ] **Launch time decided** — When your target audience is active
- [ ] **Launch announcement drafted** — Email, social posts ready to go
- [ ] **Discount code created** — "LAUNCH15" or similar for initial buzz
- [ ] **Friends and family notified** — Your first customers and promoters
- [ ] **Social posts scheduled** — Consistent posting on launch day

### Launch Day Activities

**Morning:**
- [ ] Remove store password, verify site is live
- [ ] Test checkout one more time
- [ ] Send launch email to existing contacts
- [ ] Post launch announcement on all social channels
- [ ] Notify friends and family to share

**Throughout the day:**
- [ ] Monitor for any site issues
- [ ] Respond to questions immediately
- [ ] Engage with social media comments
- [ ] Watch for orders and fulfill quickly
- [ ] Check email for customer inquiries

**Evening:**
- [ ] Review day's analytics
- [ ] Send personal thank you to first customers
- [ ] Note any issues to fix tomorrow
- [ ] Plan next day's content

### Launch Day Don'ts

- **Don't launch and disappear** — Be available to respond to issues
- **Don't expect massive sales** — Most launches are quiet; that's normal
- **Don't panic if something breaks** — Fix it calmly, communicate honestly
- **Don't change pricing immediately** — Give your initial prices time to work
- **Don't run out of inventory** — Have enough stock for realistic scenarios

---

## First Week Priorities

Launch is just the beginning. Here's what to focus on in week one.

### Days 1-2: Stabilize

- [ ] **Fix any broken features** — Prioritize checkout issues
- [ ] **Respond to every inquiry** — Within hours, not days
- [ ] **Fulfill orders same-day** — Build reputation for fast shipping
- [ ] **Monitor for issues** — Check site several times daily
- [ ] **Thank first customers** — Personal note goes a long way

### Days 3-4: Optimize

- [ ] **Review analytics** — What's working? Where are drop-offs?
- [ ] **Check email capture performance** — Pop-up showing? People signing up?
- [ ] **Review abandoned carts** — Is the sequence running? Recovery rate?
- [ ] **Gather customer feedback** — Ask what they think of the experience
- [ ] **Fix small issues** — Typos, broken links, confusing navigation

### Days 5-7: Accelerate

- [ ] **Increase marketing efforts** — More social posting, consider paid ads
- [ ] **Request reviews** — From any customers who've received products
- [ ] **Plan content calendar** — What will you post next week?
- [ ] **Evaluate initial pricing** — Are people buying? Consider adjustments
- [ ] **Plan next product additions** — What else does your audience want?

### First Week Success Metrics

Don't judge success by sales alone. Good first-week indicators:

- Website traffic increasing (any source)
- Email list growing (even 20 subscribers is progress)
- Social engagement happening (comments, shares)
- No major technical issues
- Customer questions being answered
- Orders (even just a few) processing smoothly

## Common Launch Mistakes to Avoid

Learn from others' expensive lessons.

### Mistake 1: Launching Without Testing Checkout

**The problem:** Customers get to checkout and can't complete their purchase.

**The impact:** You lose sales and customers, often permanently.

**The prevention:** Complete at least 2 full test orders on both desktop and mobile before launch.

### Mistake 2: No Email Capture From Day One

**The problem:** Visitors come and go without any way to reach them again.

**The impact:** You have to pay to reach the same people again and again.

**The prevention:** Set up email pop-up and footer form before launch. Even a simple "10% off your first order" capture works.

### Mistake 3: Missing Legal Pages

**The problem:** No privacy policy, terms, or refund policy.

**The impact:** Legal liability, customer distrust, and inability to advertise (Facebook requires privacy policy).

**The prevention:** Create all legal pages using Shopify templates as a starting point, then customize.

### Mistake 4: Perfectionism Paralysis

**The problem:** Waiting until everything is "perfect" before launching.

**The impact:** Never launching, or launching so late competitors have captured your market.

**The prevention:** Launch when "good enough"—payments work, checkout tested, products look professional. Iterate after launch.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Mobile Experience

**The problem:** Building on desktop, never testing on phones.

**The impact:** 70%+ of visitors are on mobile; if mobile is broken, most customers can't buy.

**The prevention:** Test entire purchase flow on actual mobile devices (phone, not just responsive design mode).

### Mistake 6: Underestimating Shipping Costs

**The problem:** Offering free shipping without calculating true costs.

**The impact:** Losing money on every sale; shipping costs eating entire margin.

**The prevention:** Calculate actual shipping costs including packaging. Price products or set free shipping threshold accordingly.

### Mistake 7: No Analytics Setup

**The problem:** Launching without any tracking in place.

**The impact:** No data to learn from; can't understand what's working or broken.

**The prevention:** Install GA4 and Facebook Pixel before launch. Data from day one is invaluable.

### Mistake 8: Only One Traffic Strategy

**The problem:** Relying only on Instagram, or only on SEO, or only on friends and family.

**The impact:** If that one channel fails, you have no customers.

**The prevention:** Plan at least 2-3 traffic sources: social, paid, email, SEO, influencers, etc.

## What to Do If You Get No Sales

It happens to almost everyone. Here's how to diagnose and fix it.

### First: Don't Panic

Most new stores don't get sales on day one, or even week one. The average conversion rate for new stores is under 1%, meaning you need 100+ quality visitors for even one sale.

### Diagnose the Problem

**Step 1: Check your traffic**

Open Shopify Analytics or Google Analytics.

- **No traffic (under 50 visitors)?** — Marketing problem, not store problem
- **Traffic but no add-to-carts?** — Product or price problem
- **Add-to-carts but no checkouts?** — Cart or checkout problem
- **Checkouts started but not completed?** — Checkout friction problem

**Step 2: Common causes and fixes**

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| No traffic | Nobody knows you exist | Increase marketing: social, ads, outreach |
| Traffic, no interest | Wrong audience or weak products | Validate product-market fit; adjust targeting |
| Interest, no add-to-cart | Price too high or trust issues | Check competitor pricing; add reviews/trust signals |
| Cart abandonment | Shipping costs or checkout friction | Show shipping earlier; simplify checkout |
| Checkout abandonment | Payment issues or second thoughts | Test checkout yourself; add reassurance |

### Traffic Building Tactics

If nobody's visiting:

1. **Personal network** — Message friends, family, colleagues directly
2. **Social posting** — Daily content on relevant platforms
3. **Community engagement** — Facebook groups, Reddit, forums in your niche
4. **Influencer outreach** — Free product for honest review
5. **Paid ads** — Even $10/day on Facebook/Instagram to test
6. **Content creation** — Blog posts, Pinterest pins, TikTok videos

### Trust Building Tactics

If people visit but don't buy:

1. **Add reviews** — Even testimonials from friends who tested products
2. **Show social proof** — Instagram feed, customer photos
3. **Improve photography** — Professional-looking product images
4. **Add more product info** — Answer every possible question
5. **Lower barriers** — Easier returns, satisfaction guarantee
6. **Check competitor pricing** — Are you significantly more expensive?

### The One-Week Rule

If after one week of consistent marketing (1+ hours daily) you have:

- **Under 100 visitors:** Marketing problem. Focus on traffic.
- **100+ visitors, 0 add-to-carts:** Product or presentation problem. Get feedback.
- **Add-to-carts but 0 sales:** Checkout problem. Test your own checkout thoroughly.

### When to Pivot

Consider significant changes if after 30 days of real effort:

- Still under 500 total visitors
- Conversion rate under 0.5%
- Zero sales despite consistent marketing

This might mean:
- Different products
- Different target audience
- Different marketing channels
- Price restructuring
- Complete store redesign

But give yourself the full 30 days first. Most successful stores had slow starts.
