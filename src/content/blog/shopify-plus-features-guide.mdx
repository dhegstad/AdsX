faqs:
  - question: "How much does Shopify Plus cost?"
    answer: "Shopify Plus starts at $2,300/month on a 3-year term or $2,500/month on a 1-year term. For merchants processing over $800,000/month, pricing switches to a variable fee of 0.25% of revenue. Additional costs may include implementation, third-party apps, and custom development."
  - question: "What is the difference between Shopify Advanced and Shopify Plus?"
    answer: "Shopify Plus offers unlimited staff accounts (vs. 15 on Advanced), checkout customization through Checkout Extensibility, Shopify Functions for custom discounts, up to 10 expansion stores, dedicated support with a Merchant Success Manager, and automation tools like Shopify Flow. Advanced is $299/month while Plus starts at $2,300/month."
  - question: "When should I upgrade to Shopify Plus?"
    answer: "Consider upgrading when you hit $1-2 million in annual revenue, need more than 15 staff accounts, require checkout customization, want to expand internationally with multiple storefronts, need advanced automation, or your transaction fee savings at higher volumes justify the cost difference."
  - question: "Does Shopify Plus reduce transaction fees?"
    answer: "Shopify Plus offers the lowest transaction fees in the Shopify ecosystem. When using Shopify Payments, Plus merchants pay 2.15% + 30 cents for online credit card transactions compared to 2.4% + 30 cents on Advanced. For high-volume merchants, this 0.25% savings can exceed the monthly Plus subscription cost."
  - question: "Can I negotiate Shopify Plus pricing?"
    answer: "Yes, Shopify Plus pricing is negotiable, especially for high-volume merchants. Factors that improve negotiation leverage include annual revenue above $5 million, multi-year commitments, multiple expansion stores, and migrating from a major competitor. Some merchants report negotiating down to $1,800-2,000/month or reduced percentage fees."

The question isn't whether Shopify Plus is expensive. At $2,300 per month minimum, it obviously is.

The real question is whether it's expensive *for you* given your specific revenue, operational complexity, and growth trajectory. For merchants doing $1 million or more annually, the math often works out favorably. For others, it's money better spent elsewhere.

This guide breaks down every Shopify Plus exclusive feature, calculates real ROI scenarios, and helps you determine if enterprise e-commerce makes sense for your business.

## What is Shopify Plus?

[Shopify Plus](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624) is Shopify's enterprise-tier e-commerce platform, designed for high-volume merchants who have outgrown standard plans. It powers over 47,000 brands including Gymshark, Allbirds, Heinz, Staples, and Fashion Nova.

Unlike standard Shopify plans with fixed features, Plus offers:

- Dedicated infrastructure for high-traffic events
- Deep customization capabilities standard plans don't allow
- Automation tools that eliminate manual operational tasks
- Multi-store management from a single admin
- Dedicated support and a Merchant Success Manager

The platform positions itself between standard Shopify (for SMBs) and fully custom enterprise solutions (for companies with unlimited development budgets). It's the "Goldilocks zone" for brands doing $1-500 million annually who need enterprise capabilities without enterprise complexity.

## Shopify Plus Pricing Breakdown

Understanding Plus pricing requires looking beyond the base subscription.

### Base Subscription Costs

| Term Length | Monthly Cost | Annual Total |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| 3-year commitment | $2,300/month | $27,600/year |
| 1-year commitment | $2,500/month | $30,000/year |
| Variable pricing (high volume) | 0.25% of revenue | Varies |

Variable pricing kicks in when 0.25% of your monthly revenue exceeds the base rate. This means merchants processing over $800,000/month ($9.6M annually) switch to the percentage model.

**Example at different revenue levels:**

| Annual Revenue | Monthly Revenue | Plus Cost Model | Monthly Cost |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| $2 million | $167,000 | Fixed | $2,300 |
| $5 million | $417,000 | Fixed | $2,300 |
| $10 million | $833,000 | Variable (0.25%) | $2,083 |
| $20 million | $1.67 million | Variable (0.25%) | $4,175 |
| $50 million | $4.17 million | Variable (0.25%) | $10,425 |

### Transaction Fees Comparison

Credit card processing fees are where Plus really shines for high-volume merchants.

| Plan | Online Credit Card Rate | In-Person Rate | Third-Party Gateway Fee |
|------|------------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Basic ($39/mo) | 2.9% + 30¢ | 2.7% + 0¢ | 2.0% |
| Shopify ($105/mo) | 2.7% + 30¢ | 2.5% + 0¢ | 1.0% |
| Advanced ($399/mo) | 2.4% + 30¢ | 2.4% + 0¢ | 0.6% |
| Plus ($2,300/mo) | 2.15% + 30¢ | 2.15% + 0¢ | 0.2% |

### Real Transaction Fee Savings Example

For a merchant processing $5 million annually online:

**Advanced Plan:**
- Credit card fees: $5M x 2.4% = $120,000
- Per-transaction: 100,000 orders x $0.30 = $30,000
- Total processing: $150,000
- Subscription: $399 x 12 = $4,788
- **Total annual cost: $154,788**

**Plus Plan:**
- Credit card fees: $5M x 2.15% = $107,500
- Per-transaction: 100,000 orders x $0.30 = $30,000
- Total processing: $137,500
- Subscription: $2,300 x 12 = $27,600
- **Total annual cost: $165,100**

In this scenario, Plus costs $10,312 more annually. However, if you're using features like automation (Shopify Flow) that save 10+ hours of staff time weekly, the ROI flips positive quickly.

## Shopify Plus Exclusive Features

Let's examine every feature exclusive to Plus and its practical value.

### 1. Checkout Extensibility and Customization

This is often the primary reason merchants upgrade to Plus.

**What it does:** Checkout Extensibility allows you to customize the checkout experience with custom UI elements, integrations, and logic that standard plans don't permit.

**Capabilities include:**

- **Custom checkout UI blocks** — Add trust badges, upsells, loyalty points displays, delivery date pickers, and custom fields directly in checkout
- **Payment customization** — Hide, reorder, or rename payment methods based on conditions (cart value, customer tags, etc.)
- **Shipping customization** — Show/hide shipping options, add delivery promises, integrate with 3PLs
- **Post-purchase extensions** — One-click upsells after purchase completion
- **Checkout validation** — Custom rules (address verification, fraud checks, B2B requirements)

**Why it matters:**

Standard Shopify checkout is deliberately locked down for security and compliance reasons. This protects most merchants but limits optimization opportunities.

For high-volume stores, even a 0.5% improvement in checkout conversion can mean hundreds of thousands in additional revenue. Checkout Extensibility gives you the tools to optimize without the risks of fully custom solutions.

**Real-world example:**

Fashion brand Gymshark uses checkout customization to display real-time delivery estimates, reducing cart abandonment by showing customers exactly when orders will arrive. This transparency reportedly improved checkout conversion by 8%.

### 2. Shopify Functions

Shopify Functions let you customize core commerce logic that's hardcoded on standard plans.

**Available Function APIs:**

| Function Type | What You Can Customize |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Discounts | Create discount types that don't exist natively (BOGO with conditions, tiered volume discounts, bundle discounts) |
| Shipping | Custom shipping rate calculations, carrier integrations, delivery promises |
| Payments | Payment method filtering, B2B payment terms, custom gateways |
| Cart | Cart transformations, automatic product additions, bundling logic |
| Fulfillment | Custom fulfillment routing, split shipment logic |

**Why it matters:**

On standard plans, you're limited to Shopify's built-in discount types. Need a "Buy 2 of Product A, get 50% off Product B" promotion? You'd need a third-party app that adds checkout friction.

With Functions, you build custom discount logic that runs natively within Shopify's infrastructure, maintaining checkout speed and reliability.

### 3. Shopify Flow (Automation)

Shopify Flow is an automation builder that eliminates manual operational tasks.

**Popular automation workflows:**

**Inventory Management:**
- Auto-tag products when inventory drops below threshold
- Notify team when items go out of stock
- Automatically hide sold-out variants

**Customer Segmentation:**
- Tag customers based on behavior (first purchase, repeat buyer, high-value, at-risk)
- Trigger email flows based on tags
- Apply automatic discounts to customer segments

**Order Management:**
- Auto-tag high-value orders for priority fulfillment
- Flag potentially fraudulent orders for review
- Route orders to different fulfillment centers based on location

**Marketing Triggers:**
- Add customers to specific email lists based on purchases
- Trigger review requests after delivery
- Activate loyalty rewards automatically

**Example time savings:**

A merchant manually segmenting customers and managing tags might spend 10 hours weekly. Flow automates this entirely. At $25/hour loaded labor cost, that's $13,000 annually in recovered time—more than half the Plus subscription cost from one automation.

### 4. Unlimited Staff Accounts

| Plan | Staff Account Limit |
|------|-------------------|
| Basic | 2 |
| Shopify | 5 |
| Advanced | 15 |
| Plus | Unlimited |

**Why it matters:**

As teams grow, account limitations become painful. On Advanced, you might have customer service, operations, marketing, finance, developers, and agency partners all competing for 15 seats.

Plus removes this constraint entirely and adds granular permission controls for each role.

### 5. Expansion Stores (Up to 10 Included)

Plus includes up to 10 expansion stores at no additional subscription cost.

**Use cases:**

- **International storefronts** — Separate stores for different markets (EU, UK, APAC) with localized currency, language, and fulfillment
- **B2B/Wholesale** — Dedicated wholesale portal with different pricing, minimum orders, and net terms
- **Brand sub-stores** — Separate stores for different brand lines under one parent company
- **Flash sale stores** — Isolated stores for high-traffic sales events that won't impact main store performance

On standard plans, each additional store requires a separate subscription. For merchants needing multiple storefronts, this alone can justify Plus pricing.

**Example savings:**

5 expansion stores on Advanced plan: 5 x $399 = $1,995/month
Same stores on Plus: Included in $2,300/month
**Savings: $1,695/month ($20,340/year) plus operational simplicity**

### 6. B2B on Shopify

[Shopify Plus](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624) includes native B2B functionality that would otherwise require expensive third-party solutions or custom development.

**B2B Features:**

- **Customer-specific pricing** — Show different prices to different wholesale accounts
- **Net payment terms** — Offer Net 30, Net 60, etc. without third-party apps
- **Minimum order quantities** — Enforce MOQs at the product level
- **Volume discounts** — Automatic tiered pricing based on quantity
- **Company accounts** — Multiple buyers under one company with appropriate permissions
- **Quick order** — Streamlined ordering for repeat wholesale customers
- **Draft orders** — Sales rep-created orders with approval workflows

**Why it matters:**

Most DTC brands expanding into wholesale cobble together solutions with third-party apps, separate stores, or manual processes. Plus B2B brings everything into one platform with native integrations.

### 7. Launchpad

Launchpad automates the scheduling and execution of product launches, flash sales, and promotions.

**Capabilities:**

- Schedule product visibility changes (hide/publish at specific times)
- Pre-schedule theme changes
- Automate discount activation/deactivation
- Queue inventory releases
- Coordinate multi-element launches (new collection + discount + theme change) simultaneously

**Why it matters:**

Manual flash sale execution is error-prone. Someone has to be online at midnight to publish products, activate discounts, and push theme changes. Launchpad handles this automatically with precision timing.

### 8. Dedicated Support and Merchant Success Manager

Plus merchants receive:

- **24/7 priority support** — Faster response times than standard plans
- **Merchant Success Manager** — Dedicated contact who understands your business
- **Launch support** — Hands-on help during migration or platform launches
- **Technical escalation** — Direct access to engineering teams for complex issues

**Why it matters:**

When your store goes down during a flash sale, having direct access to priority support can mean the difference between a brief incident and a catastrophic revenue loss.

### 9. Shopify Plus Academy and Resources

Plus includes access to:

- Exclusive webinars and masterclasses
- Partner agency network with vetted Plus experts
- Beta access to new Shopify features
- Plus-only Slack community for peer networking

### 10. Enhanced API Limits

Plus merchants receive significantly higher API call limits:

| Plan | API Calls (Leaky Bucket) |
|------|-------------------------|
| Advanced | 40/second, 80 burst |
| Plus | 100/second, 200 burst |

**Why it matters:**

Complex integrations with ERPs, PIMs, 3PLs, and marketing platforms require heavy API usage. Standard limits can throttle operations during peak times. Plus limits accommodate enterprise integration requirements.

## Shopify Plus vs. Advanced: Complete Comparison

| Feature | Advanced ($399/mo) | Plus ($2,300/mo) |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Staff accounts** | 15 | Unlimited |
| **Checkout customization** | No | Yes (Checkout Extensibility) |
| **Custom discount logic** | No | Yes (Shopify Functions) |
| **Automation** | Limited | Full (Shopify Flow) |
| **Expansion stores** | Additional subscriptions | Up to 10 included |
| **B2B features** | Third-party apps | Native |
| **API limits** | Standard | 2.5x higher |
| **Launch scheduling** | Manual | Launchpad |
| **Dedicated support** | No | Yes (MSM) |
| **Credit card rate** | 2.4% + 30¢ | 2.15% + 30¢ |
| **Third-party gateway fee** | 0.6% | 0.2% |

## ROI Calculation: When Does Plus Make Sense?

Let's calculate ROI for different merchant profiles.

### Scenario 1: $3 Million Annual Revenue

**Current situation (Advanced):**
- Subscription: $4,788/year
- Credit card fees (2.4%): $72,000
- Manual tasks (15 hrs/week @ $30/hr): $23,400
- No checkout optimization capability

**With Plus:**
- Subscription: $27,600/year
- Credit card fees (2.15%): $64,500
- Automation savings (Flow): $20,000 (recovered staff time)
- Checkout optimization: +2% conversion = $60,000 additional revenue

**ROI Analysis:**
- Additional Plus cost: $22,812
- Fee savings: $7,500
- Automation savings: $20,000
- Revenue lift: $60,000 (at 30% margin = $18,000 profit)
- **Net ROI: +$22,688 positive**

### Scenario 2: $10 Million Annual Revenue

**Current situation (Advanced):**
- Subscription: $4,788/year
- Credit card fees: $240,000
- Multiple apps for B2B/automation: $24,000/year
- 3 expansion stores: $14,364/year

**With Plus:**
- Subscription: $27,600/year
- Credit card fees: $215,000
- Native B2B and Flow: Included
- Expansion stores: Included

**ROI Analysis:**
- Additional Plus cost: $22,812
- Fee savings: $25,000
- App consolidation: $24,000
- Expansion store savings: $14,364
- **Net ROI: +$40,552 positive**

### Scenario 3: $800,000 Annual Revenue

**Current situation (Advanced):**
- Subscription: $4,788/year
- Credit card fees: $19,200
- Simple operations, no B2B

**With Plus:**
- Subscription: $27,600/year
- Credit card fees: $17,200
- Limited benefit from enterprise features

**ROI Analysis:**
- Additional Plus cost: $22,812
- Fee savings: $2,000
- Limited operational savings
- **Net ROI: -$20,000+ negative**

**Verdict:** At under $1M revenue with simple operations, Plus rarely makes financial sense.

## Who Actually Needs Shopify Plus?

### Clear Plus Candidates

**High-volume merchants ($2M+ annually):**
Transaction fee savings and operational efficiencies compound significantly at scale.

**B2B/Wholesale operators:**
Native B2B features eliminate the need for expensive third-party solutions and manual workflows.

**International sellers:**
Multiple expansion stores for different markets are included, saving thousands in separate subscriptions.

**Complex operations:**
If you're spending significant time on manual tasks that Flow can automate, the time savings often justify the cost.

**Brands requiring checkout customization:**
Post-purchase upsells, custom checkout fields, and payment method customization are Plus-exclusive.

### Probably Not Plus Candidates

**Sub-$1M annual revenue:**
The math rarely works unless you have specific enterprise needs.

**Simple, single-market operations:**
If you're running one straightforward store without B2B or international complexity, standard plans suffice.

**Price-sensitive startups:**
The $2,300/month is better spent on inventory, marketing, or product development in early stages.

**Low transaction volume:**
Fee savings only matter at scale; low-volume merchants benefit minimally.

## Migration Considerations

### What Migration Looks Like

Moving from standard Shopify to Plus is relatively seamless since you're staying within the Shopify ecosystem:

1. **Assessment** — Plus team evaluates your store and requirements
2. **Planning** — Migration timeline and customization scope defined
3. **Implementation** — Theme, apps, and integrations audited for Plus compatibility
4. **Testing** — Checkout customizations and automations tested
5. **Launch** — Cutover with Plus support team available

### Common Migration Challenges

**App compatibility:**
Some apps don't work with Checkout Extensibility or have Plus-specific versions. Audit your app stack before committing.

**Theme updates:**
Checkout customizations may require theme modifications. Budget for development time.

**Staff training:**
New capabilities like Flow and Functions require team training to maximize value.

**Integration updates:**
API limit changes and new capabilities may require integration partner updates.

## Negotiating Shopify Plus Pricing

Plus pricing is negotiable. Here's what influences your leverage:

**Factors that improve negotiation:**
- Annual revenue above $5 million
- Multi-year commitment (3+ years)
- Multiple expansion stores needed
- Migrating from a major competitor (BigCommerce, Magento)
- Timing (end of quarter, end of year)

**What's negotiable:**
- Base subscription rate (some report $1,800-2,000/month)
- Variable percentage for high-volume (below 0.25%)
- Implementation services
- Additional expansion stores beyond 10
- Extended trial periods

**How to negotiate:**
1. Get competitive quotes from BigCommerce Enterprise and others
2. Calculate your total platform spend (subscription + fees + apps)
3. Present specific ROI requirements to your Plus rep
4. Be willing to commit to longer terms for better rates

## Alternatives to Shopify Plus

5. **The break-even point** is typically $2-3 million annual revenue, though specific ROI depends on your operational complexity

6. **Plus pricing is negotiable**—don't accept the first quote, especially if you're high-volume or making long-term commitments
