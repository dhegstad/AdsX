faqs:
  - question: "What are the most profitable products to sell on Shopify in 2026?"
    answer: "The most profitable Shopify products in 2026 include digital products (70-95% margins), print-on-demand custom items (40-60% margins), sustainable/eco-friendly products (35-50% margins), and niche pet products (40-55% margins). Digital products like templates, courses, and software offer the highest margins since there's no inventory or shipping cost."
  - question: "How much money do I need to start a Shopify store in 2026?"
    answer: "You can start a Shopify store with as little as $29/month for the basic plan plus domain costs ($10-15/year). Print-on-demand and dropshipping require no upfront inventory investment. However, budgeting $500-2,000 for marketing, apps, and initial testing is recommended for serious businesses."
  - question: "What products should I avoid selling on Shopify?"
    answer: "Avoid low-margin commodities (generic phone cases, basic cables), highly regulated products (supplements without proper licensing, CBD), oversaturated trending items past their peak (fidget spinners), products with complex shipping requirements (fragile items, hazmat), and items with thin margins that leave no room for advertising costs."
  - question: "Is dropshipping still profitable on Shopify in 2026?"
    answer: "Yes, dropshipping remains profitable in 2026 but requires more sophisticated execution than before. Successful dropshippers focus on branded stores with unique positioning, private-label products, excellent customer service, and AI-optimized product content rather than generic stores selling commodity products."
  - question: "How do I find winning products to sell on Shopify?"
    answer: "Find winning products by analyzing trending searches on Google Trends, monitoring social commerce on TikTok and Instagram, studying competitor stores with tools like Commerce Inspector, checking wholesale marketplaces (Alibaba, Faire), reading industry reports, and testing products with small ad budgets before committing to inventory."

## How to Evaluate Product Opportunities

Before diving into specific products, you need a framework for evaluating opportunities. Not every trending product makes a good Shopify business.

### The 7-Point Product Evaluation Framework

**1. Profit Margin Potential**
Your product needs enough margin to cover:
- Product cost (ideally under 30% of retail price)
- Shipping and fulfillment (10-20% of retail)
- Marketing and customer acquisition (20-40% of retail)
- Shopify fees and payment processing (3-5%)
- Your actual profit (ideally 15-30%+)

**Target minimum**: 50%+ gross margin before marketing costs.

**2. Market Demand**
Validate demand before investing:
- Google Trends showing stable or growing interest
- Amazon Best Sellers rank in category
- Social media engagement (TikTok, Instagram)
- Search volume for related keywords
- Competitor sales indicators

**3. Competition Level**
Assess the competitive landscape:
- Number of established competitors
- Barriers to entry (capital, expertise, licensing)
- Differentiation opportunities
- Customer loyalty in the category
- Marketing saturation

**4. Shipping Complexity**
Simpler shipping means fewer headaches:
- Size and weight (affects costs dramatically)
- Fragility (breakage = returns)
- Temperature sensitivity
- Battery/hazmat restrictions
- International shipping feasibility

**5. Customer Acquisition Cost**
Some products are cheaper to market than others:
- Visual appeal (works on social media?)
- Demonstrability (easy to show value?)
- Word-of-mouth potential
- Influencer marketing fit
- SEO opportunity

**6. Repeat Purchase Potential**
Recurring revenue beats one-time sales:
- Consumable products (refills, supplies)
- Subscription potential
- Cross-sell opportunities
- Customer lifetime value

**7. Seasonality**
Understand demand patterns:
- Year-round vs. seasonal demand
- Holiday spikes (opportunity or risk?)
- Weather dependence
- Back-to-school, summer, etc.

### Red Flags to Watch For

Avoid products with these characteristics:
- **Razor-thin margins**: No room for marketing or mistakes
- **Extreme price sensitivity**: Customers only buy the cheapest option
- **High return rates**: Apparel sizing, electronics defects
- **Regulatory complexity**: Medical devices, supplements, CBD
- **Rapid trend decay**: Viral products that fade in months
- **Intellectual property issues**: Counterfeit risks, licensing requirements

## Trending Product Categories for 2026

### AI-Enhanced Products

- Productivity tools for AI workflows
