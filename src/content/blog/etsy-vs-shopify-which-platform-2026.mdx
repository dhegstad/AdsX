faqs:
  - question: "Is Etsy or Shopify better for beginners?"
    answer: "Etsy is generally better for beginners because it provides built-in traffic, requires no technical setup, and lets you start selling immediately with minimal upfront investment. You can list products and make sales the same day. Shopify requires more initial work—building a store, driving traffic, and learning e-commerce fundamentals—but offers more long-term growth potential."
  - question: "How much does it cost to sell on Etsy vs Shopify?"
    answer: "Etsy charges $0.20 per listing plus 6.5% transaction fee plus 3% + $0.25 payment processing. On $5,000 monthly revenue, that's roughly $500-550 in fees. Shopify Basic costs $39/month plus 2.9% + $0.30 payment processing, totaling approximately $190 for the same revenue. Shopify becomes more cost-effective as your revenue grows."
  - question: "Can I use both Etsy and Shopify at the same time?"
    answer: "Yes, many successful sellers use both platforms strategically. Etsy serves as a discovery channel where new customers find you through marketplace search, while Shopify becomes your owned brand destination for repeat customers and higher-margin sales. Tools like Etsy's Pattern and various sync apps make managing both platforms easier."
  - question: "When should I switch from Etsy to Shopify?"
    answer: "Consider switching or adding Shopify when: you're paying over $500/month in Etsy fees, you have repeat customers who could buy direct, algorithm changes significantly impact your visibility, you want to build an email list and own customer relationships, or you're ready to invest in building a brand beyond marketplace dependency."
  - question: "Does Shopify have more fees than Etsy?"
    answer: "At lower revenue levels, Shopify's monthly subscription makes it more expensive than Etsy's pay-per-sale model. However, Shopify's percentage-based fees are significantly lower (2.9% vs 6.5% + listing fees), so it becomes cheaper at higher volumes. The break-even point is typically around $2,000-3,000 monthly revenue, after which Shopify saves money."

Choosing between Etsy and Shopify is one of the most consequential decisions a maker or small seller will make. Pick the wrong platform and you could spend years fighting uphill—paying excessive fees, battling algorithm changes, or struggling to get traffic.

But here's what most "Etsy vs Shopify" guides miss: this isn't necessarily an either/or decision. The smartest sellers in 2026 often use both platforms strategically, leveraging each for its strengths.

This comprehensive guide will help you understand exactly when Etsy makes sense, when Shopify is the better choice, and how to think about this decision based on your specific situation, products, and goals.

## Quick Comparison: Etsy vs Shopify at a Glance

Before diving deep, here's a high-level comparison to orient you:

| Factor | Etsy | Shopify |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Monthly Cost** | $0 (pay per listing/sale) | $39-399/month |
| **Transaction Fees** | 6.5% + $0.20/listing | 0% (on Shopify Payments) |
| **Payment Processing** | 3% + $0.25 | 2.9% + $0.30 (Basic) |
| **Built-in Traffic** | Yes (95M+ active buyers) | No (you drive all traffic) |
| **Brand Ownership** | Limited (Etsy's domain) | Full ownership |
| **Customization** | Very limited | Unlimited |
| **Customer Data** | Restricted access | Full ownership |
| **Learning Curve** | Low | Medium-High |
| **Best For** | Handmade, vintage, beginners | Scaling brands, unique products |

Now let's break down each platform in detail.

## Etsy: The Marketplace Approach

Etsy is a curated online marketplace specifically designed for handmade items, vintage goods, and craft supplies. Think of it as a digital craft fair where 95+ million active buyers come specifically looking for unique, artisan products.

### Etsy Pros

**1. Built-In Traffic and Discovery**

The single biggest advantage of Etsy is that buyers are already there. When someone searches "handmade leather wallet" on Etsy, they're ready to buy. You don't need to run ads, build an audience, or figure out SEO—Etsy's existing traffic does the heavy lifting.

For new sellers, this is transformative. You can list a product and make a sale the same day without spending a dime on marketing.

**2. Trust and Credibility**

Etsy has spent years building consumer trust. Buyers know what to expect: unique products, seller protections, reliable payments. As a new seller, you benefit from this established trust immediately.

Starting on Shopify, you're asking strangers to give their credit card to an unknown website. That's a much higher bar to clear.

**3. Low Barrier to Entry**

Starting on Etsy costs almost nothing:
- No monthly fee (just $0.20 per listing)
- No technical setup required
- No domain or hosting to configure
- You can be selling within an hour

**4. Buyer Intent**

Etsy shoppers are specifically seeking handmade, unique, or vintage items. They expect (and accept) handmade production times, slight variations, and artisan pricing. You're selling to an audience that values what you do.

**5. Mobile App and Seller Tools**

Etsy's seller app makes managing your shop straightforward. Process orders, respond to messages, track stats—all from your phone. For part-time sellers, this convenience matters.

### Etsy Cons

**1. Fee Structure Adds Up**

Etsy's fees seem small individually but compound significantly:

- **$0.20 listing fee** (per item, renews every 4 months or upon sale)
- **6.5% transaction fee** (on item price + shipping)
- **3% + $0.25 payment processing** (Etsy Payments)
- **Optional: 12-15% Offsite Ads fee** (if you don't opt out and make >$10K)

On a $50 item with $5 shipping, you're paying approximately:
- $0.20 listing
- $3.58 transaction fee (6.5% of $55)
- $1.90 payment processing (3% + $0.25)
- **Total: $5.68 (10.3% of sale)**

**2. Algorithm Dependency**

Your visibility on Etsy is controlled by Etsy's search algorithm. Algorithm updates can tank your sales overnight with no warning and no recourse. Sellers who built six-figure businesses have seen 50-80% revenue drops from algorithm changes.

You're building your business on rented land.

**3. Limited Brand Building**

On Etsy, you're "SarahsLeatherGoods on Etsy"—not "Sarah's Leather Goods." Your shop exists within Etsy's design constraints, Etsy's URL structure, and Etsy's customer experience.

Building memorable brand identity is difficult when every shop looks fundamentally similar.

**4. Restricted Customer Relationships**

Etsy limits how you can communicate with customers. You can't export customer emails for marketing. You can't retarget visitors. Repeat customers often search Etsy again rather than remembering your shop name.

The customer relationship belongs to Etsy, not you.

**5. Increasing Competition and Fees**

Etsy has grown significantly, but so has competition. More sellers fighting for the same traffic, combined with steadily increasing fees, means shrinking margins for many sellers.

The Etsy of 2026 is much more competitive than the Etsy of 2016.

## Shopify: The Independent Store Approach

Shopify is an e-commerce platform that lets you build and operate your own online store. You control everything—design, pricing, customer experience, marketing—but you're also responsible for everything.

### Shopify Pros

**1. Complete Brand Ownership**

With Shopify, you own your brand entirely. Your domain, your design, your customer experience. You're building equity in an asset you control, not renting space on someone else's platform.

When customers buy from SarahsLeatherGoods.com, they remember Sarah's Leather Goods—not a marketplace.

**2. Customer Data and Relationships**

This is huge: Shopify gives you complete access to customer information. Build email lists, create customer segments, run retargeting campaigns, send abandoned cart emails. Own the relationship.

On Etsy, a customer who bought three times might forget your shop name. On Shopify, they're on your email list, getting your updates, building a relationship with your brand.

**3. Lower Fees at Scale**

Shopify's fee structure favors higher-volume sellers:

- **Monthly subscription**: $39 (Basic), $105 (Shopify), $399 (Advanced)
- **Payment processing**: 2.9% + $0.30 (Basic), down to 2.4% + $0.30 (Advanced)
- **No transaction fees** when using Shopify Payments
- **No listing fees**

The percentage fees are dramatically lower than Etsy's 6.5% + payment processing.

**4. Unlimited Customization**

Design your store exactly how you want. Custom themes, unique checkout experiences, specialized apps for any functionality. Your store can be as simple or sophisticated as you need.

Need subscription products? Done. Custom product configurators? Available. Wholesale portals? No problem.

**5. Unlimited Growth Potential**

Shopify powers businesses from first-time sellers to billion-dollar brands. There's no ceiling. As you grow, Shopify grows with you—better rates, more features, enterprise solutions if you need them.

**6. Diversified Sales Channels**

Shopify integrates with everything: Instagram Shopping, TikTok Shop, Amazon, eBay, Google Shopping, wholesale channels. One inventory, multiple sales channels, managed from one dashboard.

### Shopify Cons

**1. No Built-In Traffic**

This is the fundamental challenge: Shopify doesn't send you customers. You need to drive every single visitor through your own marketing efforts—social media, ads, SEO, email, influencers, content.

For new sellers without marketing experience, this is genuinely difficult.

**2. Monthly Costs Regardless of Sales**

Shopify charges $39-399/month whether you make $0 or $50,000. During slow months, that fixed cost hurts. For hobby sellers or those just testing the waters, this ongoing expense adds pressure.

**3. Steeper Learning Curve**

Building a Shopify store requires more skills: basic design sense, understanding of e-commerce principles, marketing fundamentals, potentially some technical knowledge. It's not hard, but it's not instant either.

**4. Ongoing Marketing Investment**

Beyond the subscription, plan to spend on marketing. Facebook ads, Google ads, influencer partnerships, email platforms—customer acquisition costs money. Budget $200-500/month minimum for meaningful ad testing.

**5. Building Trust from Zero**

New Shopify stores face the "who are you?" problem. Buyers are wary of unfamiliar websites. Building trust requires reviews, professional design, clear policies, and often time.

## Fee Comparison at Different Revenue Levels

Let's get specific about what each platform actually costs at different monthly revenue levels. Assumptions: average order value of $50, shipping included in price, no Etsy Offsite Ads.

### $1,000/Month Revenue (~20 orders)

| Cost | Etsy | Shopify Basic |
|------|------|---------------|
| Monthly/Subscription | $0 | $39 |
| Listing Fees | $4.00 | $0 |
| Transaction Fees | $65.00 | $0 |
| Payment Processing | $35.00 | $35.00 |
| **Total Fees** | **$104** | **$74** |
| **% of Revenue** | **10.4%** | **7.4%** |

**Winner at $1K: Shopify** (but you're paying $39 even with zero sales)

### $5,000/Month Revenue (~100 orders)

| Cost | Etsy | Shopify Basic |
|------|------|---------------|
| Monthly/Subscription | $0 | $39 |
| Listing Fees | $20.00 | $0 |
| Transaction Fees | $325.00 | $0 |
| Payment Processing | $175.00 | $175.00 |
| **Total Fees** | **$520** | **$214** |
| **% of Revenue** | **10.4%** | **4.3%** |

**Winner at $5K: Shopify** (saves $306/month)

### $10,000/Month Revenue (~200 orders)

| Cost | Etsy | Shopify Basic |
|------|------|---------------|
| Monthly/Subscription | $0 | $39 |
| Listing Fees | $40.00 | $0 |
| Transaction Fees | $650.00 | $0 |
| Payment Processing | $350.00 | $320.00 |
| **Total Fees** | **$1,040** | **$359** |
| **% of Revenue** | **10.4%** | **3.6%** |

**Winner at $10K: Shopify** (saves $681/month)

### $25,000/Month Revenue (~500 orders)

| Cost | Etsy | Shopify |
|------|------|---------|
| Monthly/Subscription | $0 | $105 |
| Listing Fees | $100.00 | $0 |
| Transaction Fees | $1,625.00 | $0 |
| Payment Processing | $875.00 | $725.00 |
| **Total Fees** | **$2,600** | **$830** |
| **% of Revenue** | **10.4%** | **3.3%** |

**Winner at $25K: Shopify** (saves $1,770/month = $21,240/year)

### The Break-Even Point

Based on fee structure alone, Shopify becomes more economical around **$500-700/month in revenue**. However, this ignores the biggest factor: Etsy provides traffic, Shopify doesn't.

If you'd spend $200/month on ads to drive Shopify traffic, the real break-even point is closer to **$2,500-3,000/month**.

## Who Should Stay on Etsy

Etsy remains the right choice if you match these profiles:

### 1. The Hobbyist or Side-Hustle Seller

If you're making $500-1,500/month selling handmade items on the side, Etsy's convenience likely outweighs its higher fees. The time you'd spend marketing a Shopify store might be better spent making products.

**Stay on Etsy if**: You value simplicity over optimization and don't want e-commerce to become a second job.

### 2. The New Seller Testing Products

Don't know if your products will sell? Etsy lets you test with minimal risk. List items, see what resonates, refine your offerings—all without monthly fees or marketing expenses.

**Stay on Etsy if**: You're validating product-market fit before committing to a bigger investment.

### 3. The Vintage or Supplies Seller

Vintage items and craft supplies are what Etsy was built for. The audience specifically seeks these categories. Shopify would require significant marketing to reach the same buyers.

**Stay on Etsy if**: Vintage or supplies are your primary categories.

### 4. The Search-First Seller

Some product categories have strong search volume on Etsy and weak competition. If buyers are actively searching for exactly what you make, Etsy's built-in traffic delivers significant value.

**Stay on Etsy if**: Your products have strong Etsy search demand with manageable competition.

### 5. The Time-Constrained Maker

If your competitive advantage is your product quality and you'd rather spend time making than marketing, Etsy handles the business complexity so you can focus on craft.

**Stay on Etsy if**: Marketing feels overwhelming and you want to focus on creation.

## Who Should Use Shopify

Shopify is the better choice for these profiles:

### 1. The Brand Builder

If you're building a brand that extends beyond a marketplace—with brand recognition, customer loyalty, and potential for wholesale, retail, or acquisition—Shopify is essential. You need to own your brand presence.

**Use Shopify if**: You're building a business, not just selling items.

### 2. The High-Volume Seller

Once you're consistently making $3,000+/month, Etsy fees become a significant tax on your business. At $10K/month, you're paying $600+ more than you would on Shopify. That's money for inventory, equipment, or profit.

**Use Shopify if**: You're paying more than $500/month in Etsy fees.

### 3. The Marketing-Savvy Seller

If you already have a social media following, email list, or marketing skills, Shopify lets you keep more of what you earn. Your existing audience eliminates the "no traffic" problem.

**Use Shopify if**: You can drive traffic through existing channels.

### 4. The Custom/Complex Product Seller

Some products don't fit Etsy's interface well: complex customizations, subscription products, wholesale ordering, configurable items. Shopify's app ecosystem handles virtually any product complexity.

**Use Shopify if**: Your products need functionality Etsy can't provide.

### 5. The Multi-Channel Seller

If you're selling across Instagram, TikTok, Amazon, and wholesale, managing everything from Shopify's single dashboard is far more efficient than treating Etsy as your hub.

**Use Shopify if**: You sell (or want to sell) across multiple channels.

### 6. The Control-Focused Seller

If algorithm changes and platform dependency keep you up at night, Shopify offers peace of mind. You control your destiny—for better or worse.

**Use Shopify if**: Platform dependency feels too risky.

## Who Should Use Both

Many successful sellers use both platforms strategically. This hybrid approach combines Etsy's discovery power with Shopify's ownership benefits.

### The Multi-Platform Strategy

**Etsy serves as**: A discovery and acquisition channel where new customers find you
**Shopify serves as**: Your owned brand destination for repeat customers and direct traffic

This works because:
- Etsy's search traffic introduces new customers to your products
- Happy customers learn your brand name and can find you directly
- Repeat purchases on Shopify mean higher margins
- You're diversified across platforms (never fully dependent on one)

### Who This Works For

**1. Established Etsy Sellers Ready to Scale**

You've proven product-market fit on Etsy. You have reviews, repeat customers, and consistent sales. Adding Shopify lets you capture more value from your success.

**2. Sellers with Repeat Purchase Products**

If customers buy from you multiple times (consumables, collections, gifts), directing repeat purchases to Shopify dramatically improves margins over time.

**3. Risk-Conscious Sellers**

Algorithm changes happen. Platform policy shifts happen. Having both Etsy and Shopify means no single platform change can destroy your business.

**4. Sellers Building Toward Exit**

If you might sell your business someday, Shopify's owned customer list and independent brand are far more valuable than Etsy shop history.

### How to Run Both Successfully

- Use consistent branding across platforms
- Include Shopify URL in Etsy packaging (follow Etsy's rules)
- Offer exclusive products or bundles on Shopify
- Build email capture for repeat marketing
- Consider slightly lower Shopify prices (your margins are better)
- Use inventory sync tools to prevent overselling

## Real Seller Perspectives

Let's ground this analysis in real experiences from sellers who've navigated these decisions:

### Sarah - Jewelry Designer (Etsy to Both)

> "I started on Etsy in 2019 and built it to $8K/month by 2023. But I was paying $800+ in fees monthly, and an algorithm update cut my traffic 40% overnight. I panicked.
>
> I launched my Shopify store while keeping Etsy running. First year was rough—Shopify only did $2K/month. But I built my email list religiously. Now Shopify does $12K/month with better margins, and I still do $5K on Etsy. Total revenue is higher, profit is way higher, and I sleep better knowing one platform can't kill my business."

### Marcus - Custom Leather Goods (Tried Shopify, Back to Etsy)

> "I got seduced by the 'own your business' message and went all-in on Shopify in 2024. Beautiful store, professional photos, the works. But getting traffic was brutal. I spent $3K on ads over 6 months and made maybe $4K in sales. Meanwhile, my Etsy shop was doing $3K/month on autopilot.
>
> I'm back on Etsy now and much happier. Maybe I'll try Shopify again when I'm bigger, but for a side business making $40K/year, Etsy just makes sense."

### Jennifer - Candle Maker (Shopify First)

> "I started directly on Shopify because I had 15K Instagram followers from posting candle-making content. Never touched Etsy. My followers already knew my brand, so driving traffic wasn't hard.
>
> For me, Etsy would have been a step backward—paying higher fees to reach strangers when I already had an audience. If you're building a following first, go straight to Shopify."

### David - Vintage Seller (Etsy Only)

> "Vintage selling on Shopify doesn't make sense for my business. My customers are specifically searching Etsy for vintage items. Building a standalone vintage site would require explaining to people why they should trust my curation. On Etsy, they already trust the platform.
>
> I pay $1,200/month in Etsy fees on $12K revenue. Yeah, it's steep. But finding those same buyers elsewhere would cost me more in advertising and time."

## Making the Decision: A Framework

Use this framework to clarify your own decision:

### Step 1: Define Your Goals

**Building a Brand?** Shopify is better for long-term brand equity.
**Maximizing Profit Now?** Depends on your revenue level and marketing skills.
**Minimizing Risk?** Both platforms, diversified.
**Minimizing Effort?** Etsy, especially if sales are steady.

### Step 2: Assess Your Resources

**Do you have marketing skills or budget?** If yes, Shopify becomes viable.
**Do you have time to learn e-commerce?** If limited, stay on Etsy longer.
**Do you have an existing audience?** If yes, Shopify makes immediate sense.
**Do you have capital to invest?** If no, Etsy's pay-per-sale model is safer.

### Step 3: Evaluate Your Products

**Are they search-driven?** Etsy's search traffic helps.
**Are they impulse purchases?** Social media + Shopify works well.
**Do customers repeat purchase?** Shopify's ownership matters more.
**Are they complex/customizable?** Shopify handles complexity better.

### Step 4: Calculate Your Numbers

At your current revenue:
- What are you paying in Etsy fees?
- What would Shopify cost (subscription + estimated marketing)?
- What's the fee difference?
- Is the difference worth the additional work?

### Step 5: Consider Your Risk Tolerance

**Low risk tolerance**: Run both platforms
**Medium risk tolerance**: Stay where you're succeeding, expand later
**High risk tolerance**: Commit fully to the platform matching your goals

## How to Test Shopify While Keeping Etsy

If you're on Etsy and curious about Shopify, here's a low-risk way to test:

### Phase 1: Set Up Quietly (Week 1-2)

1. [Start a Shopify free trial](https://www.shopify.com/free-trial) (14 days free, no credit card required)
2. Choose a simple, professional theme
3. Add your best-selling products (5-10 items)
4. Set up Shopify Payments
5. Create basic pages: About, Contact, Shipping, Returns

Don't overthink it. A functional store beats a perfect store that never launches.

### Phase 2: Soft Launch (Week 3-4)

1. Share your new site with existing customers who email you
2. Add your Shopify URL to your Instagram bio
3. Create a simple "Shop directly" post for social media
4. Set up basic email capture (Shopify Forms or Klaviyo free tier)

Don't announce a big launch. Just make it available.

### Phase 3: Evaluate (Week 5-8)

Track:
- How many visits from social media?
- Any organic sales?
- Email signups?
- Customer feedback on the experience?

After 30-60 days, you'll have real data about whether your audience will follow you to Shopify.

### Phase 4: Decide

**If Shopify shows promise**: Continue building, gradually shift marketing focus
**If Shopify is flat**: Keep it as a backup, focus energy on Etsy
**Either way**: You now have platform diversification

### Don't Do This

- Don't immediately abandon Etsy
- Don't spam your Etsy customers about your new site (violates Etsy policies)
- Don't expect Shopify to match Etsy revenue immediately
- Don't give up after one month of low sales

## The Bottom Line

There's no universally "right" platform. The best choice depends on your specific situation:

**Choose Etsy if** you're starting out, testing products, have limited marketing skills/budget, sell vintage or supplies, or value convenience over optimization.

**Choose Shopify if** you're building a brand, have marketing capabilities, want to own customer relationships, are paying high Etsy fees, or need advanced e-commerce features.

**Choose Both if** you want the discovery benefits of Etsy plus the ownership benefits of Shopify, and you're willing to manage two platforms.

The question isn't "Which platform is better?" but "Which platform is better *for you, right now*?" And that answer might change as your business evolves.
