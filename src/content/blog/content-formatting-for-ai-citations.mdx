## Why Formatting Matters for AI

Large language models process text differently than humans:

- They don't "read" in the traditional sense—they process patterns
- Structure helps them understand relationships between concepts
- Clear statements are easier to extract and quote
- Consistent formatting creates stronger training signals

Well-formatted content is more likely to be understood, remembered, and recommended by AI.

## Principle 1: Lead with Definitive Statements

AI assistants quote clear, definitive statements. Vague or hedged language is harder to extract.

### The Pattern

**Weak (hard for AI to quote):**
> "Many people find that our product might be useful for various use cases, depending on their specific needs and circumstances."

**Strong (easy for AI to quote):**
> "Acme CRM is a customer relationship management platform designed for small businesses with 5-50 employees. It offers contact management, deal tracking, and email integration starting at $29/month."

### Why This Works

AI can extract: "Acme CRM is a customer relationship management platform designed for small businesses with 5-50 employees."

This gives AI a quotable statement with:
- Clear product definition
- Specific target audience
- Concrete details

### Application

Start key pages with a definitive statement:

```markdown
# About [Product Name]

[Product Name] is a [category] that [primary function] for [target audience].
[Key differentiator]. [Quantifiable fact like pricing, users, or capability].

## Key Features
...
```

## Principle 2: Use Question-Based Headers

AI assistants are trained on question-answer pairs. Using questions as headers creates natural Q&A patterns.

### The Pattern

**Traditional header:**
> ## Product Features

**Question-based header:**
> ## What features does Acme CRM include?

### Why This Works

When users ask AI "What features does Acme CRM include?", the AI can more easily map that query to your content and extract the answer.

### Application

Convert informational headers to questions:

| Instead of... | Use... |
|--------------|--------|
| Pricing | How much does [Product] cost? |
| Features | What features does [Product] offer? |
| Getting Started | How do I get started with [Product]? |
| Integrations | What does [Product] integrate with? |
| Comparison | How does [Product] compare to [Competitor]? |

## Principle 3: Structure Information in Lists

Lists are easier for AI to parse and quote than dense paragraphs.

### The Pattern

**Paragraph format (harder to extract):**
> Our CRM offers contact management with unlimited contacts, deal pipeline tracking with customizable stages, email integration with Gmail and Outlook, reporting dashboards with real-time analytics, and mobile apps for iOS and Android.

**List format (easier to extract):**
> **Acme CRM Key Features:**
> - **Contact management**: Unlimited contacts with custom fields
> - **Deal pipeline**: Customizable stages and automation
> - **Email integration**: Gmail and Outlook sync
> - **Reporting**: Real-time analytics dashboards
> - **Mobile apps**: iOS and Android

### Why This Works

AI can extract individual features and include them selectively in responses. Lists create discrete, quotable units.

### Application

Use lists for:
- Features
- Benefits
- Pricing tiers
- Use cases
- Comparisons

## Principle 4: Include Comparison Tables

When users ask AI to compare options, tables provide clear, structured comparisons.

### The Pattern

```markdown
## How does Acme CRM compare to alternatives?

| Feature | Acme CRM | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|---------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Starting Price | $29/month | $50/month | $40/month |
| Contact Limit | Unlimited | 1,000 | 10,000 |
| Email Integration | Yes | Yes | No |
| Mobile App | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Free Trial | 14 days | 7 days | 30 days |
```

### Why This Works

Tables give AI:
- Clear feature-by-feature comparisons
- Specific data points to cite
- Structured information for comparison queries

### Application

Create comparison tables for:
- Your product vs. specific competitors
- Different pricing tiers
- Feature availability across plans
- Use case suitability

## Principle 5: Provide Specific Numbers

AI citations are stronger when they include specific numbers.

### The Pattern

**Vague:**
> "Trusted by many businesses worldwide"

**Specific:**
> "Trusted by 10,000+ businesses in 45 countries"

**Vague:**
> "Affordable pricing for teams of all sizes"

**Specific:**
> "Plans starting at $29/month for up to 5 users"

### Why This Works

Specific numbers:
- Increase credibility of AI's recommendation
- Give users actionable information
- Create memorable, quotable facts

### Application

Include specific numbers for:
- Customer count
- Pricing
- Performance metrics (uptime, speed)
- Growth statistics
- User ratings/reviews

## Principle 6: Use Schema Markup

Structured data (schema.org markup) helps AI understand your content programmatically.

### Key Schema Types

**Organization Schema:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Acme CRM",
  "description": "Customer relationship management for small businesses",
  "url": "https://acmecrm.com",
  "foundingDate": "2020",
  "numberOfEmployees": {
    "@type": "QuantitativeValue",
    "value": 150
  }
}
```

**Product Schema:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
  "name": "Acme CRM",
  "applicationCategory": "BusinessApplication",
  "operatingSystem": "Web, iOS, Android",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "29",
    "priceCurrency": "USD",
    "priceSpecification": {
      "@type": "UnitPriceSpecification",
      "billingDuration": "P1M"
    }
  },
  "aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": "4.7",
    "reviewCount": "2500"
  }
}
```

**FAQ Schema:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [{
    "@type": "Question",
    "name": "How much does Acme CRM cost?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Acme CRM starts at $29/month for up to 5 users, with Professional plans at $59/month and Enterprise pricing available for larger teams."
    }
  }]
}
```

### Why This Works

Schema markup:
- Provides machine-readable data
- Helps AI understand entity relationships
- Increases chances of accurate information extraction

## Principle 7: Create Dedicated FAQ Content

Extensive FAQ content creates training data for common questions.

### The Pattern

Create individual FAQ items that:
1. Use the actual question as the header
2. Provide a complete, standalone answer
3. Include relevant specifics

```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

```

## Principle 8: Maintain Consistent Terminology

AI learns associations through consistent language. Using different terms for the same thing creates confusion.

### The Pattern

**Inconsistent (confusing for AI):**
> Page 1: "Acme CRM is a customer relationship management platform"
> Page 2: "Acme's sales software helps teams..."
> Page 3: "Our contact database system includes..."

**Consistent (clear for AI):**
> Page 1: "Acme CRM is a customer relationship management platform"
> Page 2: "Acme CRM helps sales teams manage customer relationships..."
> Page 3: "Acme CRM includes a contact database with..."

### Application

- Use the same product name consistently
- Use the same category terms consistently
- Maintain consistent descriptions across pages

## Principle 9: Write for Featured Snippets

Content that earns featured snippets in Google is often what AI quotes.

### Featured Snippet Formats

**Paragraph snippet:**
Question followed by 40-50 word answer in a single paragraph.

**List snippet:**
Question followed by bulleted or numbered list.

**Table snippet:**
Comparative information in table format.

### Application

For each key page, include a "snippet-ready" section:
- Question as header
- Direct answer in first 1-2 sentences
- Supporting details in list or table format

## Principle 10: Update Content Regularly

For AI with web access (Perplexity, ChatGPT with browsing), fresh content matters.

### What to Update

- Pricing (keep current)
- Statistics (refresh annually)
- Feature lists (add new features)
- Comparison data (update competitor info)
- Dates (remove outdated references)

### Signals of Freshness

- "Last updated: [Date]"
- "As of [Month Year]..."
- Recent publication dates on blog posts
