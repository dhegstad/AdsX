faqs:
  - question: "What metrics should I track for AI visibility?"
    answer: "The essential metrics are: Share of Voice, AI Platform Referral Traffic, AI Conversion Rate, Brand Search Lift, Sentiment Score, Recommendation Position, Competitor Gap, Content Citation Rate, Query Coverage, and Revenue Attribution. Track these weekly to understand trends and optimize effectively."
  - question: "How do I track AI referral traffic?"
    answer: "Use Google Analytics 4 to monitor referrals from chat.openai.com, perplexity.ai, claude.ai, and other AI platforms. Create a custom segment for AI traffic and track it separately. Also implement UTM parameters on any links you control and use post-purchase surveys to capture untracked AI influence."
  - question: "What's a good share of voice in AI recommendations?"
    answer: "A good share of voice depends on your market position. Market leaders should aim for 30%+, challengers for 15-25%, and niche players for 10-15% in their specific category. The key is consistent improvement—aim for 5-10% monthly growth in share of voice."
  - question: "How often should I check AI visibility metrics?"
    answer: "Track core metrics weekly to spot trends and issues early. Do deeper analysis monthly for strategic decisions. Review competitive positioning quarterly. Daily monitoring is only necessary during major campaigns or after significant changes."

Effective AI visibility management requires consistent measurement. But with so many possible metrics to track, which ones actually matter?

Based on analyzing hundreds of AI visibility campaigns, here are the 10 metrics that best predict success—and how to track each one.

## The Essential 10 Metrics

### 1. Share of Voice (SOV)

**What it measures**: How often your brand is mentioned when users ask AI about your category.

**How to track it**:
- Run standardized queries across ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity
- Track which brands are mentioned in each response
- Calculate your mention rate vs. competitors
- Use automation for consistent weekly tracking

**Benchmark targets**:
| Market Position | Target SOV |
|----------------|-----------|
| Market Leader | 30%+ |
| Challenger | 15-25% |
| Niche Player | 10-15% |

**Weekly action**: Run 20 category-relevant queries and track your mention rate.

### 2. AI Platform Referral Traffic

**What it measures**: Direct visitors coming from AI platforms to your website.

**How to track it**:
- In GA4, go to Reports → Acquisition → Traffic Acquisition
- Filter for sources containing "openai", "perplexity", "anthropic", "claude"
- Create a custom segment for "AI Platform Traffic"

**Benchmark targets**:
- Early stage: 100+ monthly AI visitors
- Growing: 500+ monthly
- Mature: 2,000+ monthly

**Weekly action**: Check week-over-week change in AI referral volume.

---

### 3. AI Visitor Conversion Rate

**What it measures**: How well AI-referred visitors convert compared to other channels.

**How to track it**:
- Set up conversion goals in GA4
- Compare AI segment conversion rate to site average
- Track by conversion type (signup, purchase, demo request)

**Benchmark targets**:
- Minimum: Equal to site average
- Good: 1.5x site average
- Excellent: 2x+ site average

**Weekly action**: Compare AI conversion rate to previous 4-week average.

---

### 4. Brand Search Lift

**What it measures**: Increase in people searching for your brand name, often influenced by AI recommendations.

**How to track it**:
- Google Search Console for branded query impressions
- Google Trends for relative search volume
- Compare to pre-AI visibility baseline

**Benchmark targets**:
- Monthly growth: 5-15%
- Quarterly growth: 20-40%
- Significant lift correlates with AI visibility improvements

**Weekly action**: Check branded search impressions vs. previous week.

---

### 5. Sentiment Score

**What it measures**: Whether AI mentions your brand positively, neutrally, or negatively.

**How to track it**:
- Analyze AI responses mentioning your brand
- Categorize as positive, neutral, or negative
- Calculate weighted sentiment score

**Scoring example**:
```
Positive mention: +1
Neutral mention: 0
Negative mention: -2

Sentiment Score = Sum of scores / Number of mentions
```

**Benchmark targets**:
- Minimum: 0.3 (slightly positive)
- Good: 0.5-0.7
- Excellent: 0.8+

**Weekly action**: Run 10 brand-specific queries and score sentiment.

---

### 6. Recommendation Position

**What it measures**: Where you appear in AI recommendation lists (first, second, third, etc.).

**How to track it**:
- When mentioned, note your position in the list
- Track position distribution over time
- Calculate average position

**Benchmark targets**:
| Position | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| 1st | Highest click-through |
| 2nd-3rd | Strong visibility |
| 4th-5th | Moderate visibility |
| 6th+ | Low impact |

**Weekly action**: Track position for your top 10 target queries.

---

### 7. Competitor Gap

**What it measures**: The difference between your share of voice and your top competitor's.

**How to track it**:
- Track SOV for your top 3 competitors
- Calculate the gap (Competitor SOV - Your SOV)
- Monitor gap trend over time

**Benchmark targets**:
- Closing gap: Negative trend (you're catching up)
- Maintaining position: Stable gap
- Falling behind: Growing gap

**Weekly action**: Calculate gap vs. #1 competitor.

---

### 8. Content Citation Rate

**What it measures**: How often AI references your content as a source.

**How to track it**:
- For platforms that cite sources (Perplexity), track citations
- Note which content pieces get cited
- Measure citation frequency

**Benchmark targets**:
- Early stage: Any citations
- Growing: 5+ weekly citations
- Mature: 20+ weekly citations

**Weekly action**: Count citations in Perplexity for brand queries.

---

### 9. Query Coverage

**What it measures**: What percentage of relevant queries you appear in.

**How to track it**:
- Define your target query set (50-100 queries)
- Test weekly and track appearance rate
- Identify gaps and opportunities

**Benchmark targets**:
| Coverage | Status |
|----------|--------|
| <20% | Low visibility |
| 20-40% | Developing |
| 40-60% | Good |
| 60%+ | Strong |

**Weekly action**: Test your top 20 queries and calculate coverage %.

### 10. Revenue Attribution

**What it measures**: Revenue directly or indirectly tied to AI visibility.

**How to track it**:
- Direct: AI referral × conversion rate × AOV
- Survey: % of customers citing AI × total revenue
- Correlation: Revenue change vs. AI visibility change

**Calculation**:
```
Weekly AI Revenue =
  (Direct AI conversions × AOV) +
  (Survey attribution × Weekly revenue × AI %) +
  (Brand search lift attribution)
```

**Benchmark targets**:
- Track trend, not absolute number
- Aim for consistent week-over-week growth
- Compare to investment for ROI

**Weekly action**: Update revenue attribution calculation.

## Common Tracking Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Tracking Too Many Metrics

More metrics doesn't mean better insights. These 10 cover the essentials—adding more creates noise without clarity.

### Mistake 2: Inconsistent Query Sets

Using different queries each week makes trends meaningless. Standardize your query set and stick to it.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Competitor Data

Your absolute numbers mean less than your relative position. Always track competitor performance alongside your own.

### Mistake 4: Short-Term Focus

Weekly data is noisy. Always look at 4-week rolling averages for decision-making.

### Mistake 5: Not Acting on Data

The best dashboard is useless without action. Every weekly review should generate at least one specific action item.

## Setting Up Automated Tracking

### Basic Automation (Spreadsheet)

1. Create a Google Sheet with metric columns
2. Set calendar reminder for weekly data entry
3. Add formulas for trends and comparisons
4. Create simple charts for visualization

### Intermediate Automation

1. Use Google Apps Script to pull GA4 data
2. Create template for query testing results
3. Build automated trend calculations
4. Schedule weekly email reports

### Advanced Automation

1. API connections to all data sources
2. Automated AI query testing
3. Real-time dashboard updates
4. Automated alerting for significant changes

## Key Takeaways

1. **Focus on these 10 metrics** - They cover all essential AI visibility dimensions
2. **Track weekly** - Consistent measurement enables trend analysis
3. **Compare to competitors** - Relative position matters more than absolute numbers
4. **Act on insights** - Data without action is worthless
5. **Build toward automation** - Start manual, scale up as you prove value
