faqs:
  - question: "Can I import all my Etsy listings to Shopify automatically?"
    answer: "Yes, you can use apps like LitCommerce, Matrixify (formerly Excelify), or Ablestar Bulk Product Editor to automate the import process. These tools connect to your Etsy shop, pull listing data including titles, descriptions, prices, and images, and create corresponding products in Shopify. Manual CSV import is also possible but requires more data formatting work."
  - question: "What Etsy data does NOT transfer to Shopify?"
    answer: "Several important data types cannot transfer: Etsy reviews and star ratings, favorites/wishlists from customers, your Etsy search ranking and SEO equity, Etsy Ads history and performance data, customer email addresses (Etsy doesn't provide these), and transaction/sales history. You'll need to rebuild reviews on Shopify and develop new SEO from scratch."
  - question: "How long does it take to import Etsy listings to Shopify?"
    answer: "Timeline depends on your method and listing count. Manual CSV import of 50-100 products takes 4-8 hours including cleanup. Automated apps can import 100+ listings in 1-2 hours but may require 2-4 hours of post-import optimization. Budget 1-2 weeks total for a thorough migration of 100+ listings including quality checks and optimization."
  - question: "Should I import all my Etsy listings or start fresh on Shopify?"
    answer: "Consider a hybrid approach: import your top-performing products (best sellers, highest reviews, best margins) but leave underperformers behind. Starting fresh with select products lets you optimize each listing for your new store rather than carrying over outdated descriptions and poor-performing items. Many sellers import 50-70% of their catalog."
  - question: "Do I need to set up redirects from my Etsy shop to Shopify?"
    answer: "You cannot create traditional redirects from Etsy URLs since you don't control Etsy's domain. However, you can update your Etsy shop announcement and profile to mention your new website, add cards to Etsy orders directing customers to your Shopify store, and update any external links you control (social media, blogs, directories) to point to your new store."

You've decided to move from Etsy to Shopify—congratulations on taking control of your brand. But now comes the practical challenge: how do you transfer months or years of carefully crafted listings without starting from scratch?

The good news is that you don't have to manually recreate every product. Whether you have 20 listings or 2,000, there are efficient methods to import your Etsy products to Shopify while preserving your product data, descriptions, and images.

This comprehensive guide walks you through every import method, explains exactly what transfers and what doesn't, and helps you avoid the mistakes that trip up most sellers during migration.

## Why Import Instead of Starting Fresh?

Before diving into the how-to, let's address whether importing is the right approach for you.

### The Case for Importing

**Time savings**: Manually creating products in Shopify takes 15-30 minutes each. With 100 products, that's 25-50 hours of work. Importing can reduce this to hours.

**Consistency**: Your product descriptions, pricing, and variants are already refined from Etsy sales. Importing preserves this work.

**Fewer errors**: Manual data entry introduces typos and mistakes. Importing maintains data accuracy.

**Historical reference**: Even if you optimize listings after import, having the original data as a starting point beats blank product pages.

### When Starting Fresh Makes Sense

Consider creating products manually if:

- You have fewer than 10 products
- Your Etsy descriptions are outdated or keyword-stuffed
- You want to completely rebrand your product line
- Many products are discontinued or low performers
- Your images need complete replacement anyway

### The Hybrid Approach

Most sellers benefit from a middle path: import your top performers and best-documented products, but leave behind underperformers, outdated items, and products with poor descriptions. This gives you the efficiency of importing while creating space to improve your catalog.

## Understanding What Transfers (And What Doesn't)

Before you begin importing, set realistic expectations about what data moves between platforms.

### What DOES Transfer

| Data Type | Transfer Status | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Product titles | Yes | May need optimization for Shopify SEO |
| Product descriptions | Yes | HTML formatting usually preserved |
| Prices | Yes | Currency matches your Shopify settings |
| Variant options (size, color) | Yes | May require mapping |
| SKUs | Yes | If you used them on Etsy |
| Product images | Yes | Downloaded and re-uploaded |
| Inventory quantities | Yes | If tracked on Etsy |
| Product tags | Partial | Need to be converted to Shopify tags |
| Weight for shipping | Yes | If specified on Etsy |

### What DOES NOT Transfer

| Data Type | Why It Doesn't Transfer | Impact |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| Reviews and ratings | Etsy-proprietary data | Must rebuild social proof |
| Favorites/wishlists | Customer data stays on Etsy | No customer wishlists |
| Search rankings/SEO | Platform-specific algorithms | Start fresh in Google/AI |
| Sales history | Etsy transaction data | No historical reports |
| Customer emails | Etsy doesn't share these | No email list to import |
| Etsy Ads data | Campaign data is locked | Can't transfer ad learnings |
| Star Seller badges | Etsy credibility signals | Build new trust on Shopify |

### The Review Problem

This deserves special attention because reviews are often your most valuable Etsy asset. Unfortunately, Etsy reviews cannot be directly imported to Shopify—they belong to Etsy's ecosystem.

**Your options:**

1. **Screenshot reviews**: Create an image gallery of your best Etsy reviews to display on your Shopify store as testimonials (be transparent that these are from Etsy)

2. **Use review import apps**: Some apps like Judge.me or Loox can help import reviews if you have customer emails from order inserts or other sources

3. **Request fresh reviews**: After your first Shopify sales, actively request reviews from customers

4. **Run both platforms**: Keep Etsy open during transition to continue building reviews while establishing Shopify

## Method 1: Manual CSV Export and Import

The manual method gives you the most control and costs nothing, but requires more hands-on work.

### Step 1: Export Your Etsy Listings

1. Log into your Etsy seller account
2. Navigate to **Shop Manager > Settings > Options**
3. Click the **Download Data** tab
4. Select **Download CSV** under the listings section
5. Save the file to your computer

Your export will include:
- All active, inactive, and draft listings
- Product titles and descriptions
- Prices and quantities
- Variation details
- Tags and categories
- Image URLs (not the images themselves)

### Step 2: Download Your Product Images

Etsy's CSV includes image URLs, but you need the actual image files for Shopify.

**Manual method:**
1. Visit each listing on Etsy
2. Right-click and save each image
3. Organize by product in folders

**Bulk download options:**
- Use browser extensions like "DownThemAll" or "Tab Save"
- Use a URL-to-image bulk downloader
- Some import apps handle this automatically

**Important**: Save images at the highest quality available. Etsy allows up to 10 images per listing—make sure you capture all of them.

### Step 3: Format Data for Shopify

Shopify requires specific CSV column headers. You'll need to transform your Etsy export.

**Required Shopify CSV columns:**
```
Handle, Title, Body (HTML), Vendor, Type, Tags, Published,
Option1 Name, Option1 Value, Option2 Name, Option2 Value,
Variant SKU, Variant Grams, Variant Inventory Qty,
Variant Price, Image Src
```

**Key mapping:**
| Etsy Field | Shopify Field | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| TITLE | Title | Direct transfer |
| DESCRIPTION | Body (HTML) | Keep HTML formatting |
| PRICE | Variant Price | Numeric only |
| QUANTITY | Variant Inventory Qty | Numeric only |
| TAGS | Tags | Comma-separated |
| — | Handle | Create URL-friendly version of title |
| — | Vendor | Your brand name |
| — | Published | TRUE or FALSE |

**Creating the Handle:**
The Handle becomes your product URL. Convert titles like:
- "Handmade Leather Wallet - Minimalist Design"
- becomes: `handmade-leather-wallet-minimalist-design`

Use lowercase, replace spaces with hyphens, remove special characters.

### Step 4: Handle Variants Correctly

Etsy and Shopify handle variants differently, and this is where most import errors occur.

**Etsy structure**: Each variant can have its own listing row

**Shopify structure**:
- First row: Full product info + first variant
- Additional rows: Same Handle + different variant values only

**Example Shopify CSV for a product with size variants:**

| Handle | Title | Body | Option1 Name | Option1 Value | Price |
|--------|-------|------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| leather-wallet | Leather Wallet | Description here | Size | Small | 49.99 |
| leather-wallet | | | Size | Medium | 54.99 |
| leather-wallet | | | Size | Large | 59.99 |

Notice how rows 2-3 only need the Handle and variant-specific fields.

### Step 5: Import to Shopify

1. Go to **Shopify Admin > Products > Import**
2. Click **Add file** and select your formatted CSV
3. Preview the import to check for errors
4. Click **Import products**
5. After import completes, manually upload images to each product

### Manual Method: Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- Free (no app costs)
- Complete control over data mapping
- Good for smaller catalogs (under 50 products)
- Learn the data structure deeply

**Cons:**
- Time-intensive for large catalogs
- Error-prone without spreadsheet experience
- Manual image upload required
- Variant formatting is complex

## Method 2: Using Import Apps (Recommended for 50+ Products)

For larger catalogs or sellers who want automation, third-party apps streamline the process significantly.

### LitCommerce

**Best for**: Ongoing multi-channel selling (keeping both Etsy and Shopify)

**What it does:**

### Choosing the Right App

| Your Situation | Best App Choice |
|---------------|-----------------|
| 20-50 products, one-time move | LitCommerce free or manual CSV |
| 50-200 products, one-time move | Matrixify |
| Running both platforms ongoing | LitCommerce paid |
| Complex variants, large catalog | Matrixify |
| Need bulk editing after import | Ablestar |

## Handling Product Images Properly

Images often cause the most import headaches. Here's how to handle them correctly.

### Image Quality Standards

**Shopify requirements:**
- Maximum file size: 20MB per image
- Recommended resolution: 2048 x 2048 pixels
- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- Square images work best with most themes

**Best practices:**
- Maintain consistent sizing across products
- Use white or neutral backgrounds for main images
- Include lifestyle/contextual images as secondary
- Optimize file size for fast loading (under 500KB ideal)

### Bulk Image Import Methods

**Method 1: URL-based import (fastest)**

If your Etsy images are still accessible via URL:
1. Include image URLs in your CSV `Image Src` column
2. Shopify downloads and hosts them automatically
3. Multiple images: Add multiple rows with same Handle, different Image Src

**Method 2: Manual upload (most reliable)**

1. Download all images from Etsy
2. Organize in folders by product
3. After CSV import, go to each product in Shopify
4. Upload images directly to product pages

**Method 3: App-assisted upload**

LitCommerce and similar apps handle images automatically:
1. Connect accounts
2. App downloads images from Etsy
3. App uploads to Shopify
4. Image associations preserved

### Common Image Import Issues

**Problem**: Blurry images after import
**Solution**: Etsy may have served compressed images. Re-upload original high-res files.

**Problem**: Wrong image order
**Solution**: Shopify shows images in upload order. Rearrange in product editor or use specific Position column in CSV.

**Problem**: Images not importing
**Solution**: Check URL accessibility. Etsy URLs may be temporary or require authentication. Download and re-upload manually.

**Problem**: Alt text not imported
**Solution**: Etsy alt text doesn't transfer. Add alt text in Shopify for SEO/accessibility.

## Setting Up Redirects from Etsy

Traditional URL redirects (301 redirects) aren't possible from Etsy because you don't control the Etsy domain. However, you can still guide traffic to your new store.

### What You CAN Do

**Update your Etsy shop announcement:**
Add text like: "We've launched our own website at [yourstore.com]! Same great products, better shopping experience."

**Update your Etsy shop About section:**
Mention your new website prominently.

**Include cards in Etsy orders:**
Physical cards in every Etsy shipment directing customers to your new store. Consider offering a first-order discount.

**Update social media links:**
Change all your Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook links from Etsy to Shopify.

**Update external mentions:**
Contact blogs, directories, or websites that link to your Etsy shop and request they update to your Shopify URL.

**Google Search Console:**
If you had a standalone domain that redirected to Etsy, you can now redirect that domain to Shopify.

### Building New SEO

Since you can't transfer Etsy's search equity, plan to build fresh SEO:

1. **Optimize product titles** for Google search (not just Etsy keywords)
2. **Write unique meta descriptions** for each product
3. **Create collection pages** targeting category keywords
4. **Start a blog** with content related to your products
5. **Build backlinks** to your new store
6. **Submit sitemap** to Google Search Console

### Timeline for SEO Results

Expect 3-6 months before your Shopify store ranks for competitive terms. During this time:
- Keep Etsy active for traffic
- Invest in paid advertising to drive immediate sales
- Focus on email list building for owned traffic

## Cleaning Up and Optimizing After Import

Importing is just the first step. Post-import optimization is critical for success.

### Immediate Post-Import Checklist

**Within 24 hours of import:**
- [ ] Check that all products imported correctly
- [ ] Verify pricing is accurate (watch for currency issues)
- [ ] Confirm variants display correctly
- [ ] Test that images load properly
- [ ] Review inventory quantities

### Product Optimization Tasks

**Titles (Week 1):**
Etsy titles are often keyword-stuffed. Rewrite for Shopify:

Before: "Leather Wallet Mens Wallet Minimalist Wallet Bifold Wallet Gift For Him Personalized"

After: "Minimalist Leather Bifold Wallet | Personalized Men's Gift"

**Descriptions (Week 1-2):**
- Remove Etsy-specific language ("Thanks for visiting my Etsy shop!")
- Add your brand voice
- Include shipping and return info specific to your Shopify policies
- Optimize for AI search with natural, benefit-focused language

**Collections/Categories (Week 1):**
- Create logical collection structure
- Assign products to collections
- Set up collection pages with descriptions
- Consider seasonal or occasion-based collections

**SEO Metadata (Week 2):**
- Write unique meta titles (under 60 characters)
- Write unique meta descriptions (under 155 characters)
- Optimize URL handles for keywords
- Add alt text to all images

### Quality Control Process

**Spot check 10% of products:**
1. Select random products across categories
2. Verify all information is accurate
3. Check mobile display
4. Test add-to-cart functionality
5. Confirm variant selection works

**Common issues to fix:**
- Missing variants
- Incorrect prices (especially if currencies differ)
- Broken image links
- HTML formatting errors in descriptions
- Duplicate products from import errors

## Common Import Mistakes to Avoid

Learn from others' errors to save yourself time and headaches.

### Mistake 1: Importing Everything

**The error**: Moving all 500 Etsy listings regardless of performance.

**Why it's a problem**: You carry over underperformers, outdated products, and clutter that hurts your new store's perceived quality.

**The fix**: Export your Etsy sales data. Identify your top 50% of products by revenue. Import those first. Evaluate whether bottom performers deserve a spot.

### Mistake 2: Not Backing Up Before Import

**The error**: Running imports without saving original data.

**Why it's a problem**: Import errors can corrupt data, and you lose the original if something goes wrong.

**The fix**: Always keep your original Etsy CSV export. Export your Shopify products before running any import. Store backups in cloud storage.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Variant Formatting

**The error**: Importing variants as separate products instead of variant options.

**Why it's a problem**: A t-shirt with 5 sizes becomes 5 separate products instead of 1 product with 5 variants.

**The fix**: Study Shopify's variant structure before importing. Use the Handle field correctly. Test with a few products before bulk import.

### Mistake 4: Rushing Image Quality

**The error**: Accepting whatever image quality imports automatically.

**Why it's a problem**: Blurry, poorly cropped, or inconsistent images kill conversion rates.

**The fix**: After import, review every product's images. Re-upload original high-res files where needed. Maintain consistent sizing and style.

### Mistake 5: Copying Etsy Descriptions Verbatim

**The error**: Keeping "Welcome to my Etsy shop!" and Etsy-specific language.

**Why it's a problem**: Looks unprofessional and confuses customers who are on your Shopify store.

**The fix**: Search and replace Etsy-specific terms. Rewrite descriptions for your branded experience. Remove any mentions of Etsy policies that don't apply.

### Mistake 6: Forgetting Mobile Testing

**The error**: Only checking imported products on desktop.

**Why it's a problem**: 70%+ of e-commerce traffic is mobile. Formatting issues may only appear on phones.

**The fix**: After import, view every collection and sample products on mobile devices. Check that images, descriptions, and variants display correctly.

### Mistake 7: Not Testing Checkout

**The error**: Assuming products work because they imported successfully.

**Why it's a problem**: Import issues with shipping weights, inventory tracking, or variant pricing may only appear at checkout.

**The fix**: Place test orders for various products. Test different variants. Verify shipping calculations. Complete full checkout flow.
