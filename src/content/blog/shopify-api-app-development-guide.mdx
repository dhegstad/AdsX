  - question: "What are the different types of Shopify APIs?"
    answer: "Shopify offers several API types including the Admin API (REST and GraphQL) for store management, Storefront API for customer-facing experiences, Partner API for app and theme management, Payments Apps API for payment processing, and various specialized APIs like the Checkout API and Ajax API for specific functionalities."
  - question: "How do I authenticate with the Shopify API?"
    answer: "Shopify uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Public and custom apps use the OAuth flow to obtain access tokens, while private apps use API keys and passwords. Access tokens can be online (user-specific, short-lived) or offline (long-lived for background operations). All API calls must include the access token in the X-Shopify-Access-Token header."
  - question: "What is the Shopify Partner Program and how do I join?"
    answer: "The Shopify Partner Program is free to join and gives you access to development stores, the Partner Dashboard, and the ability to publish apps on the Shopify App Store. You earn revenue through app sales, theme sales, and referrals. Sign up at partners.shopify.com with your business information."
  - question: "Should I use REST or GraphQL for the Shopify Admin API?"
    answer: "GraphQL is Shopify's recommended approach for new development. It offers better performance through single-request data fetching, more efficient rate limiting (based on query cost rather than call count), and access to newer features first. REST is still supported but GraphQL provides more flexibility and efficiency for complex operations."
  - question: "What are the most common Shopify API endpoints?"
    answer: "The most commonly used endpoints include Products (CRUD operations, variants, images), Orders (retrieval, fulfillment, transactions), Customers (profiles, addresses, tags), Inventory (levels, locations, adjustments), and Webhooks (event subscriptions). These cover the core operations needed for most e-commerce integrations and apps."

## Understanding Shopify's API Ecosystem

Shopify provides multiple APIs, each designed for specific use cases. Choosing the right API for your project is the first critical decision you'll make as a developer.

### Admin API: The Core of Store Management

The Admin API is what most developers work with. It provides access to store data and management functions, available in both REST and GraphQL versions.

**REST Admin API**
- Traditional endpoint-based architecture
- Straightforward for simple CRUD operations
- Rate limited to 40 requests per second (leaky bucket)
- Well-documented with extensive examples

**GraphQL Admin API**
- Shopify's recommended approach for new development
- Query exactly the data you need in a single request
- Cost-based rate limiting (more efficient)
- Access to newer features first

Here's a comparison of fetching a product with both approaches:

```javascript
// REST API - Multiple calls may be needed
const response = await fetch(
  `https://${shop}/admin/api/2024-01/products/${productId}.json`,
  {
    headers: {
      'X-Shopify-Access-Token': accessToken,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  }
);

// GraphQL API - Get exactly what you need
const query = `
  query getProduct($id: ID!) {
    product(id: $id) {
      title
      description
      variants(first: 10) {
        edges {
          node {
            price
            inventoryQuantity
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

### Storefront API: Customer-Facing Experiences

The Storefront API is designed for building custom storefronts, mobile apps, and headless commerce experiences. Unlike the Admin API, it's meant for public-facing applications.

Key capabilities include:
- Product browsing and search
- Cart management
- Customer authentication
- Checkout creation
- Collection queries

```graphql
# Storefront API query example
query getProducts {
  products(first: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        title
        priceRange {
          minVariantPrice {
            amount
            currencyCode
          }
        }
        images(first: 1) {
          edges {
            node {
              url
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Partner API

The Partner API gives access to your Partner Dashboard data programmatically. Use it to:
- Manage app installations
- Track recurring revenue
- Access development stores
- Monitor app performance metrics

### Payments Apps API

For developers building payment gateways or alternative payment methods, the Payments Apps API provides the framework for processing transactions securely within Shopify's checkout flow.

### Other Specialized APIs

- **Checkout API**: Customize the checkout experience
- **Ajax API**: Client-side cart and product operations
- **Multipass API**: Single sign-on for Plus merchants
- **Marketing Events API**: Track marketing campaign performance

## Authentication and Authorization

Understanding Shopify's authentication system is crucial for building secure apps. [Shopify](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624) uses OAuth 2.0, the industry standard for API authorization.

### OAuth 2.0 Flow for Public Apps

The OAuth flow for Shopify apps follows these steps:

1. **Merchant initiates installation** from your app listing or install link
2. **Your app redirects** to Shopify's authorization URL
3. **Merchant approves** requested permissions (scopes)
4. **Shopify redirects** back with a temporary authorization code
5. **Your app exchanges** the code for an access token
6. **Store the token** securely for future API calls

```javascript
// Step 1: Generate the authorization URL
const authUrl = `https://${shop}/admin/oauth/authorize?` +
  `client_id=${API_KEY}&` +
  `scope=${SCOPES}&` +
  `redirect_uri=${REDIRECT_URI}&` +
  `state=${nonce}`;

// Step 5: Exchange code for access token
const tokenResponse = await fetch(
  `https://${shop}/admin/oauth/access_token`,
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      client_id: API_KEY,
      client_secret: API_SECRET,
      code: authCode
    })
  }
);

const { access_token } = await tokenResponse.json();
```

### Access Token Types

**Offline Access Tokens**
- Long-lived tokens for background operations
- Persist until the app is uninstalled
- Used for webhooks, scheduled jobs, background sync
- Request with `access_mode=offline` (default)

**Online Access Tokens**
- Short-lived, user-specific tokens
- Expire when the user's session ends
- Appropriate for user-initiated actions
- Request with `access_mode=online`

### API Scopes

Scopes define what your app can access. Request only what you need—excessive scopes reduce merchant trust and app approval likelihood.

Common scopes include:
- `read_products`, `write_products`
- `read_orders`, `write_orders`
- `read_customers`, `write_customers`
- `read_inventory`, `write_inventory`
- `read_fulfillments`, `write_fulfillments`

```javascript
const SCOPES = [
  'read_products',
  'write_products',
  'read_orders',
  'read_customers'
].join(',');
```

### Securing Your App

Security best practices for Shopify apps:

1. **Verify webhook signatures** using HMAC
2. **Validate OAuth callbacks** with state parameters
3. **Verify request authenticity** for embedded apps
4. **Never expose your API secret**
5. **Use HTTPS everywhere**
6. **Store tokens encrypted**

```javascript
// Verify webhook HMAC
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(body, hmacHeader) {
  const hash = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', API_SECRET)
    .update(body, 'utf8')
    .digest('base64');

  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(hash),
    Buffer.from(hmacHeader)
  );
}
```

## Common API Endpoints and Operations

Let's explore the most frequently used API operations you'll encounter in Shopify development.

### Products API

Products are central to any e-commerce operation. The Products API lets you manage the entire product catalog.

```graphql
# Create a product with variants
mutation createProduct($input: ProductInput!) {
  productCreate(input: $input) {
    product {
      id
      title
      variants(first: 5) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            price
            sku
          }
        }
      }
    }
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

Key product operations:
- Create, read, update, delete products
- Manage product variants (sizes, colors)
- Handle product images and media
- Update inventory levels
- Manage metafields for custom data

### Orders API

Order management is critical for fulfillment apps, analytics tools, and ERP integrations.

```javascript
// Fetch orders with REST API
const orders = await fetch(
  `https://${shop}/admin/api/2024-01/orders.json?` +
  `status=open&limit=50`,
  {
    headers: {
      'X-Shopify-Access-Token': accessToken
    }
  }
);

// Common order operations
// - Retrieve order details
// - Create fulfillments
// - Process refunds
// - Add order notes
// - Update shipping information
```

### Customers API

Customer data powers personalization, marketing automation, and loyalty programs.

```graphql
query getCustomer($id: ID!) {
  customer(id: $id) {
    firstName
    lastName
    email
    orders(first: 10) {
      edges {
        node {
          totalPriceSet {
            shopMoney {
              amount
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    tags
    metafields(first: 5) {
      edges {
        node {
          key
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Webhooks

Webhooks enable real-time event-driven architecture. Instead of polling for changes, your app receives notifications when events occur.

```javascript
// Register a webhook
const webhookResponse = await fetch(
  `https://${shop}/admin/api/2024-01/webhooks.json`,
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'X-Shopify-Access-Token': accessToken,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      webhook: {
        topic: 'orders/create',
        address: 'https://yourapp.com/webhooks/orders',
        format: 'json'
      }
    })
  }
);
```

Essential webhook topics:
- `orders/create`, `orders/updated`, `orders/paid`
- `products/create`, `products/update`, `products/delete`
- `customers/create`, `customers/update`
- `app/uninstalled` (critical for cleanup)
- `inventory_levels/update`

### Inventory Management

For apps dealing with stock levels and multi-location inventory:

```graphql
mutation adjustInventory($input: InventoryAdjustQuantityInput!) {
  inventoryAdjustQuantity(input: $input) {
    inventoryLevel {
      available
      location {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## App Development Fundamentals

Building a Shopify app involves several architectural decisions and best practices.

### App Types

**Public Apps**
- Listed on the Shopify App Store
- Available to all merchants
- Require Shopify review and approval
- Use OAuth for authentication

**Custom Apps**
- Built for a single store
- Direct API credentials (no OAuth)
- Not listed publicly
- Ideal for specific merchant needs

**Private Apps** (Legacy)
- Being deprecated in favor of custom apps
- Direct API access
- No App Bridge functionality

### Embedded vs. Non-Embedded Apps

**Embedded Apps**
- Run inside Shopify Admin
- Use App Bridge for integration
- Seamless merchant experience
- Required for App Store listing

**Non-Embedded Apps**
- Open in separate browser tab
- Simpler to build
- Less integrated experience
- May be appropriate for specific use cases

### Technology Stack

Shopify provides official libraries and frameworks:

**Shopify CLI**
```bash
# Install Shopify CLI
npm install -g @shopify/cli

# Create a new app
shopify app init

# Start development server
shopify app dev
```

**App Bridge**
```javascript
import createApp from '@shopify/app-bridge';
import { Redirect } from '@shopify/app-bridge/actions';

const app = createApp({
  apiKey: API_KEY,
  host: window.__SHOPIFY_HOST__,
});

// Navigate within Shopify Admin
const redirect = Redirect.create(app);
redirect.dispatch(Redirect.Action.ADMIN_PATH, '/products');
```

**Polaris Design System**
```jsx
import { Page, Card, Button } from '@shopify/polaris';

function ProductList() {
  return (
    <Page title="Products">
      <Card sectioned>
        <Button primary onClick={handleSync}>
          Sync Products
        </Button>
      </Card>
    </Page>
  );
}
```

### App Architecture Best Practices

1. **Session Management**
   - Store session tokens securely
   - Handle token refresh appropriately
   - Clear data on uninstall webhook

2. **Rate Limit Handling**
   - Implement exponential backoff
   - Queue and batch requests
   - Monitor rate limit headers

3. **Data Storage**
   - Use metafields for shop-specific data
   - Maintain your own database for complex data
   - Consider GDPR compliance

4. **Error Handling**
   - Handle API errors gracefully
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Log errors for debugging

```javascript
// Rate limit handling example
async function shopifyRequest(url, options, retries = 3) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, options);

    if (response.status === 429) {
      const retryAfter = response.headers.get('Retry-After') || 2;
      await sleep(retryAfter * 1000);
      return shopifyRequest(url, options, retries - 1);
    }

    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    if (retries > 0) {
      await sleep(1000);
      return shopifyRequest(url, options, retries - 1);
    }
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Bulk Operations

For large data processing, use bulk operations to avoid rate limits:

```graphql
mutation bulkOperation {
  bulkOperationRunQuery(
    query: """
      {
        products {
          edges {
            node {
              id
              title
              variants {
                edges {
                  node {
                    id
                    price
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    """
  ) {
    bulkOperation {
      id
      status
    }
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```

### Subscriptions and Billing

Implement app charges using the Billing API:

```graphql
mutation createSubscription {
  appSubscriptionCreate(
    name: "Pro Plan"
    returnUrl: "https://yourapp.com/billing/callback"
    lineItems: [
      {
        plan: {
          appRecurringPricingDetails: {
            price: { amount: 9.99, currencyCode: USD }
            interval: EVERY_30_DAYS
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  ) {
    appSubscription {
      id
    }
    confirmationUrl
    userErrors {
      field
      message
    }
  }
}
```
