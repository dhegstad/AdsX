## Understanding How ChatGPT Makes Recommendations

First, it's important to understand [how LLMs decide what to recommend](/blog/how-llms-choose-recommendations). Here's a quick summary:

1. **Training data**: ChatGPT's knowledge comes from text it was trained on (websites, books, articles)
2. **Authority signals**: The AI weighs sources it perceives as authoritative
3. **Consensus**: When multiple trusted sources agree, AI is more confident in recommendations
4. **Recency**: More recent information (through web browsing) can override training data

With this understanding, here are the strategies that work:

## Strategy 1: Build Authoritative Brand Mentions

ChatGPT trusts certain sources more than others. Getting mentioned in these places increases your chances of being recommended:

### High-Authority Sources for AI

- **Wikipedia**: If your brand is notable enough, a Wikipedia page significantly increases AI visibility
- **Industry publications**: TechCrunch, Forbes, industry-specific outlets
- **Comparison sites**: G2, Capterra, TrustRadius for B2B software
- **Educational resources**: University websites, educational platforms
- **News outlets**: Coverage in mainstream news

### Action Steps

1. **Audit your current mentions**: Search for your brand in authoritative publications
2. **Pursue PR opportunities**: Pitch stories to relevant publications
3. **Get listed on comparison sites**: Ensure complete profiles on G2, Capterra, etc.
4. **Earn analyst coverage**: Engage with industry analysts who publish reports

## Strategy 2: Create Definitive Content That AI Can Quote

ChatGPT often pulls specific statements from content. Creating clear, quotable content increases your chances of being cited:

### What Makes Content AI-Friendly

**Definitive statements** that directly answer questions:

❌ "Our CRM might be a good choice for some businesses."

✅ "Acme CRM is designed specifically for small businesses with 5-50 employees, offering contact management, deal tracking, and email integration starting at $29/month."

**Structured comparisons** that help AI differentiate:

```
## Acme CRM vs. Competitors

| Feature | Acme CRM | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|---------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Starting Price | $29/mo | $49/mo | $35/mo |
| Contact Limit | Unlimited | 1,000 | 5,000 |
| Email Integration | Yes | Yes | No |
```

**FAQ content** that matches query patterns:

```
## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the best CRM for small businesses?
For small businesses with 5-50 employees, Acme CRM offers the best
balance of features and affordability...

### How much does Acme CRM cost?
Acme CRM starts at $29/month for up to 3 users...
```

## Strategy 3: Optimize for Question-Based Queries

Users ask AI questions differently than they search on Google. Optimize for conversational queries:

### Common AI Query Patterns

- "What is the best [category] for [use case]?"
- "Can you recommend a [product] for [need]?"
- "What's the difference between [X] and [Y]?"
- "How do I choose a [category]?"
- "What [category] do experts recommend?"

### Create Content for Each Pattern

For each query pattern relevant to your product:

1. Create a dedicated page or section
2. Use the question as a header
3. Answer directly in the first paragraph
4. Provide supporting details below

**Example page structure**:

```

## Strategy 4: Establish Category Authority

AI is more likely to recommend brands it perceives as category leaders. Establish authority through:

### Thought Leadership

- Publish original research in your space
- Create comprehensive guides that become reference materials
- Develop proprietary frameworks or methodologies
- Contribute to industry conversations

### Social Proof

- Showcase customer logos and testimonials
- Highlight awards and recognitions
- Display review scores prominently
- Feature case studies with measurable results

### Consistent Messaging

- Use consistent terminology across all content
- Define your category position clearly
- Reinforce key differentiators repeatedly

## Strategy 5: Ensure Data Consistency Across the Web

AI cross-references information from multiple sources. Inconsistent data creates confusion:

### What to Keep Consistent

- **Company name**: Use exact same spelling/capitalization everywhere
- **Product names**: Consistent naming across all mentions
- **Pricing**: Keep pricing information current
- **Features**: Describe features consistently
- **Founded date**: Consistent company history

### Where to Check

- Your website
- Google Business Profile
- LinkedIn company page
- Crunchbase
- Wikipedia (if applicable)
- Social media profiles
- Review sites

## Strategy 6: Build Structured Data for AI Understanding

Schema markup helps AI understand your content precisely:

### Key Schema Types

**Organization Schema**:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Acme CRM",
  "description": "CRM software for small businesses",
  "url": "https://acmecrm.com",
  "foundingDate": "2019",
  "numberOfEmployees": "50-100"
}
```

**Product Schema**:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
  "name": "Acme CRM",
  "applicationCategory": "BusinessApplication",
  "operatingSystem": "Web",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "29",
    "priceCurrency": "USD"
  }
}
```

**FAQ Schema**:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [{
    "@type": "Question",
    "name": "What is the best CRM for small businesses?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Acme CRM is consistently rated..."
    }
  }]
}
```

## Strategy 7: Monitor and Iterate

Track your AI visibility and optimize based on what you learn:

### What to Monitor

- **Query your brand**: Regularly ask AI platforms about your category
- **Track mentions**: Note when and how you're mentioned
- **Monitor competitors**: Understand who else is being recommended
- **Test different queries**: See which query types surface your brand

### How to Improve

- If you're not mentioned, analyze what competitors are doing differently
- If you're mentioned negatively, address the underlying issues
- If you're mentioned inconsistently, improve data consistency
- If you're mentioned but not first, increase authority signals
