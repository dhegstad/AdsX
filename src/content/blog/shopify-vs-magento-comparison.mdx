  - question: "Is Shopify better than Magento for small businesses?"
    answer: "For most small businesses, Shopify is the better choice due to its lower startup costs, easier setup, built-in hosting, and minimal technical requirements. You can launch a professional store within hours without any coding knowledge. Magento requires significant technical expertise and infrastructure investment that typically doesn't make sense for smaller operations."
  - question: "Can Magento handle more products than Shopify?"
    answer: "Yes, Magento can handle significantly more products than Shopify. Magento has been known to power stores with over 500,000 SKUs and can be optimized for catalogs of virtually any size. Shopify has a limit of 50,000 variants per store and 100 variants per product, though Shopify Plus offers higher limits. For massive catalogs, Magento is typically the better choice."
  - question: "How much does it cost to migrate from Magento to Shopify?"
    answer: "Migration costs vary widely based on store complexity. A basic migration (products, customers, orders) typically costs $5,000-$15,000. Complex migrations involving custom functionality, multiple integrations, and extensive customization can range from $25,000 to $100,000+. Consider data migration tools, design recreation, SEO preservation, and testing time when budgeting."
  - question: "Which platform is better for international selling?"
    answer: "Both platforms support international selling, but they approach it differently. Shopify Markets makes multi-currency, multi-language selling accessible to all merchants. Magento's multi-store architecture is more powerful but requires technical setup. For simpler international needs, Shopify is easier. For complex multi-region operations with unique requirements per market, Magento offers more flexibility."
  - question: "Do I need a developer to run a Shopify or Magento store?"
    answer: "Shopify can be operated without a developer for most standard use cases. The admin interface is user-friendly, and the theme customizer handles basic design changes. Magento almost always requires developer support for setup, maintenance, updates, and customization. Budget for ongoing developer costs if choosing Magento, typically $50-200+/hour for qualified Magento developers."

Choosing the right e-commerce platform is one of the most consequential decisions you'll make for your online business. The platform you select will influence everything from daily operations to long-term scalability, customer experience to operational costs.

Two platforms consistently dominate the conversation: **Shopify** and **Magento** (now Adobe Commerce). Both power millions of online stores worldwide, but they represent fundamentally different approaches to e-commerce.

This comprehensive guide compares Shopify and Magento across every dimension that matters: features, pricing, scalability, technical requirements, customization, and more. By the end, you'll have the clarity needed to make the right choice for your business.

## Platform Overview

### What is Shopify?

[Shopify](https://shopify.pxf.io/c/6318547/3797171/13624) is a fully-hosted, cloud-based e-commerce platform that launched in 2006. It has grown to power over 4 million active stores globally, from small startups to major brands like Gymshark, Allbirds, and Heinz.

Shopify's philosophy centers on **accessibility and simplicity**. The platform handles hosting, security, and technical infrastructure, allowing merchants to focus on selling. With its drag-and-drop interface and extensive app ecosystem, Shopify enables anyone to launch a professional online store without writing code.

**Key Shopify Statistics (2026):**
- Powers 4+ million active online stores
- Processes over $500 billion in annual GMV

### What is Magento (Adobe Commerce)?

Magento's philosophy centers on **power and customization**. The platform provides virtually unlimited flexibility for developers to build exactly what a business needs. This power comes with complexity: Magento requires significant technical expertise and infrastructure investment.

**Key Magento Statistics (2026):**
- Powers 250,000+ active stores
- Available in two editions: Open Source (free) and Adobe Commerce (paid)
- Over 5,000 extensions in the marketplace

## Feature Comparison

|---------|---------|---------|
| **Hosting** | Included (cloud-based) | Self-hosted or Adobe Cloud |
| **Setup Difficulty** | Easy (hours to launch) | Complex (weeks to months) |
| **Technical Skills Required** | None to basic | Advanced (PHP, MySQL, etc.) |
| **Product Limits** | 50,000 variants per store | Virtually unlimited |
| **Themes/Templates** | 100+ free and paid | 1,000+ (community/paid) |
| **App/Extension Ecosystem** | 8,000+ apps | 5,000+ extensions |
| **Multi-Store** | Shopify Plus only | Built-in (all editions) |
| **Multi-Currency** | Built-in (Shopify Markets) | Extension or custom dev |
| **Multi-Language** | Built-in | Built-in with complexity |

### Built-in vs. Extension-Based Features

**Shopify's Approach:** Most essential features come built-in or through first-party solutions. Payments, shipping, analytics, and basic marketing tools work out of the box. This creates a cohesive, integrated experience.

**Magento's Approach:** The core platform provides fundamental e-commerce functionality, with specialized features added through extensions. This modular approach offers flexibility but requires more careful planning and integration work.

- Teams without dedicated developers
- Businesses wanting fast time-to-market
- Merchants prioritizing simplicity over complexity
- Companies seeking predictable costs

- Companies with dedicated development teams
- Businesses requiring unlimited customization
- Organizations with massive catalogs (500K+ SKUs)
- B2B operations with complex pricing
- Companies needing complete data control
- Businesses with existing Magento expertise

### The Honest Assessment

For most businesses reading this comparison, **Shopify is the better choice**. The platform handles 95% of e-commerce use cases with dramatically less complexity, cost, and risk than Magento.

The exception: If you have existing Magento expertise, a running Magento store, or genuinely unique requirements that Shopify cannot address, Magento may be worth the investment.
