\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec3 AI is reaching a point where everyone can have a personal super-assistant that helps them learn and do almost anything. Who gets access to that level of intelligence will shape whether AI expands opportunity or reinforces the same divides.\cb1 \
\cb2 We\'92ve been working to make powerful AI accessible to everyone through our free product and low-cost subscription tier, ChatGPT Go, which has launched in 171 countries since August. Today we\'92re\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-go/"}}{\fldrslt \ul bringing Go to the U.S. and everywhere ChatGPT is available\uc0\u8288 }}, giving people expanded access to messaging, image creation, file uploads and memory for $8 USD/month. In the coming weeks, we\'92re also planning to start testing ads in the U.S. for the free and Go tiers, so more people can benefit from our tools with fewer usage limits or without having to pay. Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise subscriptions will not include ads.\cb1 \
\cb2 People trust ChatGPT for many important and personal tasks, so as we introduce ads, it\'92s crucial we preserve what makes ChatGPT valuable in the first place. That means you need to trust that ChatGPT\'92s responses are driven by what\'92s objectively useful, never by advertising. You need to know that your data and conversations are protected and never sold to advertisers. And we need to keep a high bar and give you control over your experience so you see truly relevant, high-quality ads\'97and can turn off personalization if you want.\cb1 \
\cb2 Given that, we want to be clear about the principles that guide our approach to advertising:\cb1 \

\fs41\fsmilli20923 \cf0 \cb2 Our ads principles\cb1 \

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec3 Mission alignment:\'a0
\f0\b0 Our mission is to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity; our pursuit of advertising is always in support of that mission and making AI more accessible.\cb1 \

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec3 Answer independence:\'a0
\f0\b0 Ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you. Answers are optimized based on what's most helpful to you. Ads are always separate and clearly labeled.\cb1 \

\f0\b0 We keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers, and we never sell your data to advertisers.\cb1 \

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec3 Choice and control:\'a0
\f0\b0 You control how your data is used. You can turn off personalization, and you can clear the data used for ads at any time. We\'92ll always offer a way to not see ads in ChatGPT, including a paid tier that\'92s ad-free.\cb1 \

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec3 Long-term value:\'a0
\f0\b0 We do not optimize for time spent in ChatGPT. We prioritize user trust and user experience over revenue.\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \cb2 We\'92re not launching ads yet, but we do plan to start testing in the coming weeks for logged in adults in the U.S. on the free and Go tiers. To start, we plan to test ads at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there\'92s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation. Ads will be clearly labeled and separated from the organic answer. You\'92ll be able to learn more about why you\'92re seeing that ad, or dismiss any ad and tell us why. During our test, we will not show ads in accounts where the user tells us or we predict that they are under 18, and ads are not eligible to appear near sensitive or regulated topics like health, mental health or politics.\cb1 \
\cb2 Here\'92s an example of what the first ad formats we plan to test could look like:\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \strokec0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \cb2 \strokec3 The best ads are useful, entertaining, and help people discover new products and services. Given what AI can do, we're excited to develop new experiences over time that people find more helpful and relevant than any other ads. Conversational interfaces create possibilities for people to go beyond static messages and links. For example, soon you might see an ad and be able to directly ask the questions you need to make a purchase decision.\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \cb2 \strokec3 Ads also can be transformative for small businesses and emerging brands trying to compete. AI tools level the playing field even further, allowing anyone to create high-quality experiences that help people discover options they might never have found otherwise.\cb1 \
\cb2 We\'92ll learn from feedback and refine how ads show up over time, but our commitment to putting users first and maintaining trust won\'92t change. By starting our ad platform from the ground up with these principles in place, we can align our incentives with what people want from ChatGPT. Our long-term focus remains on building products that millions of people and businesses find valuable enough to pay for. Our enterprise and subscription businesses are already strong, and we believe in having a diverse revenue model where ads can play a part in making intelligence more accessible to everyone.\cb1 \
\cb2 Once we begin testing our first ad formats in the coming weeks and months, we look forward to getting people's feedback and ensuring that ads can support broad access to AI and keep the trust that makes ChatGPT valuable.\cb1 \
