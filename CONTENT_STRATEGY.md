## Content Writing Guidelines for SEO + LLM Optimization

### Structure for AI Citation

1. **Lead with a definitive statement** (first paragraph)
   - "GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) is the practice of optimizing content so AI systems cite your brand."
   - Make it quotable and factual

2. **Use question-based headers** (H2s)
   - "What is GEO?"
   - "How does GEO differ from SEO?"
   - "Why does GEO matter in 2026?"

3. **Provide specific numbers**
   - Statistics, pricing, percentages
   - AI loves citing specific data

4. **Include comparison tables**
   - Easy for AI to parse and cite
   - Great for featured snippets

5. **Add FAQ section with schema**
   - 3-4 FAQs per post minimum
   - Use actual questions people ask

### SEO Best Practices

1. **Target one primary keyword per post**
   - Include in title, H1, first paragraph, meta description
   - Use naturally 3-5 times in body

2. **Include related keywords**
   - Use semantic variations
   - Cover related questions

3. **Internal linking**
   - Link to 3-5 related posts
   - Use descriptive anchor text

4. **External sources**
   - Cite authoritative sources (builds trust for AI too)
   - Link to official documentation when relevant

5. **Meta elements**
   - Title: 50-60 characters, keyword-front-loaded
   - Description: 150-160 characters, include CTA
   - Image alt text: Descriptive with keywords

### LLM-Specific Optimization

1. **Entity clarity**
   - Clearly define what your brand/product is
   - Use consistent terminology

   - FAQ schema (required)
   - Article schema
   - Organization mentions

4. **Third-party validation**

3. Include platform-specific terminology and features
4. Reference official platform documentation/guidelines
5. Add comparison tables (Platform A vs Platform B)

2. **Semantic context** - How to connect products to use cases
3. **Complete attributes** - Checklist of required product data
4. **Q&A optimization** - How to structure FAQ content
5. **Testing methods** - How to verify AI recommends your products
