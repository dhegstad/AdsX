# AdsX Service Definition

## What Clients Get for $4,250/month*

### Core Service: AI Visibility Optimization

**The Problem We Solve:**
Your brand is either being recommended by AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini) or it isn't. Most brands are invisible. We fix that.

## Monthly Deliverables

### 1. AI Visibility Monitoring & Reporting

**What we track:**
- Brand mentions across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Google AI
- Share of voice vs. competitors (how often you're recommended vs. them)
